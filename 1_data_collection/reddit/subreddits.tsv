climateskeptics	Climate Skeptics: Trying to see through the alarmism	"Seeing past hyperbole, alarmism and environmentalism driven politics.

This subreddit is about climate related environmentalism and alarmism.  

Rule: 

1. Don't disparage the sub as a whole. It is our experience that those who do generally don't contribute anything of substance to the discussion. 

Around 97% of the people on here agree that CO2 causes warming, that there has been warming, and that humans have contributed to increased CO2 in the atmosphere."

ClimateCrisis	Climate change: the science, energy, politics, Denial industry, etc.	"Anything related to climate change / global warming: the science, energy, ethics, over-consumption, politics, economics, the Denial industry, psychology, personal choices, etc.

Unlike r/environment this subreddit will have numerous mods - and they will actually monitor and maintain spam so that valid submissions are not lost to the broken spam filter. Also, the mods here will actually respond to requests for help."
carboncapture	News on CCS and Carbon capture technology	This is a subreddit whose focus is on industrial, biological, or natural methods of carbon capture and sequestration.
sustainability	Sustainability: The Capacity to Endure	"Sustainability is the ability of system to endure. While most people associate the term with the environment, true longevity requires social and economical sustainability as well as ecological sustainability.

###Rules

1. **No greenwashing.** Please do not submit content about companies, products, or initiatives that falsely claim to be sustainable for promotional purposes. You can read more about greenwashing [here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing)

2. **Original sources only.** While it's fine to link to an article discussing a scientific study, please make sure that submissions are to either a primary or secondary source. [Linkjacking](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=linkjack) will be removed, but we encourage you to resubmit from the original source.

3. **No spam.** This includes excessive self-promotion. Review Reddit's rules for [self promotion](/wiki/selfpromotion) and [spam](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499).

4. **Follow Reddiquette.** Overly aggressive comments or those containing slurs will be subject to removal. 

###[Related Subreddits](/r/sustainability/wiki/related)"
climate_discussion	A place to discuss our future	"/r/Climate_Discussion is a subreddit having an ongoing discussion about climate change, our response to it, and most importantly, actions we can take to make our future sustainable and habitable for everyone on the planet.    

Currently, the discussion about climate change finds itself often stuck in a state of cynicism, nihilism, misconceptions, and discontinuity. Most climate related subreddits or forums on the internet exist only as a place to aggregate dire news releases on the subject. 

We hope this can serve as a place for more thorough and strategy orientated discussion, from an engaged realists perspective, on how we can meet these challenges that we face. 




###Posting Rules

1. Be respectful to others - this includes no hostility, racism, sexism, bigotry, etc.

2. Submissions and comments must be related to our changing climate.

3. For people posting their own content, make sure to follow Reddit's rules for [self promotion](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion) and [spam](https://reddit.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204536499). If you do not, your post will be removed and **you may be banned based on moderator discretion**. 
 
 In order to better ensure the safety of our users, posts with link shorteners will be filtered.

 Surveys posted by users with no prior activity in the community will be removed.

carbontax	Carbon Tax: about the best way to stop global warming 	"Scientists agree: carbon emissions acidify the ocean and cause global warming.

Economists agree: taxing carbon is the best way to emit less carbon.

So why aren't more people talking about taxing carbon? "
ClimateActionPlan	Climate Action Plan	"Have you ever felt extreme dread and lack of hope for the future? 
This subreddit is to help you with that. 

Right now scientists and activists around the world are working to create a brighter future for humanity. We already have the technology to ensure that we can adapt to this changing world. 

Whether it's portable hydroponic farms to desalination plants, we have the tech to ensure that humanity will have food and water in even the most inhospitable conditions. 

When it comes to carbon sequestration, we're already working on it. From researching iron fertilization to building facilities that pump CO2 into the ground, we're actively working on reducing humanity's greenhouse gases.  

Do not lose hope, we've got this. 

Posts on this subreddit are for any action-oriented news on methods being used, developed, proposed, etc to combat climate change. Whether it's news of a facility that's opened up that sucks out CO2, or more zero-emissions power being used.


**Rules:**

1. **All submissions must clearly relate to climate action.**

deep_ecology	Deep Ecology	"# Deep Ecology

/r/deep_ecology: For discussion of deep ecology, the environmental philosophy that the cause of ecocide is civilization decline with the inevitable chaotic lifestyle choices as a result and that to fix it we must make fundamental changes to the way we live, and how to re-order our civilization to be sustainable and existentially rewarding. 

>Naess saw two different forms of environmentalism, not necessarily incompatible with each other. One he called the “long-range deep ecology movement” and the other, the “shallow ecology movement.” The word “deep” in part referred to the level of questioning of our purposes and values when arguing in environmental conflicts. The “deep” movement involves deep questioning, right down to fundamental root causes. The short-term, shallow approach stops before the ultimate level of fundamental change, often promoting technological fixes (e.g. recycling, increased automotive efficiency, export-driven monocultural organic agriculture) based on the same consumption-oriented values and methods of the industrial economy. The long-range deep approach involves redesigning our whole systems based on values and methods that truly preserve the ecological and cultural diversity of natural systems. - [*Deep Ecology Movement*](http://www.deepecology.org/deepecology.htm)

**The Drought reddit**

**Drought** - an extended period when a region notes a deficiency in its water supply whether surface or underground water. A drought can last for months or years, or may be declared after as few as 15 days. Generally, this occurs when a region receives consistently below average precipitation. It can have a substantial impact on the ecosystem and agriculture of the affected region. Although droughts can persist for several years, even a short, intense drought can cause significant damage and harm to the local economy. Prolonged drought has caused cause mass migrations and humanitarian crises.

This is where we challenge the culture of passivity that surrounds climate change. It will be the defining issue of our generation and it's time we recognize it.

[**Find your local 350 chapter and get involved!**](http://local.350.org/)

***

***Our Mission***

350.org is building a global grassroots movement to solve the climate crisis. Our online campaigns, grassroots organizing, and mass public actions are led from the bottom up by thousands of volunteer organizers in over 188 countries.

350 means climate safety. To preserve our planet, scientists tell us we must reduce the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere from its current levels of 400 parts per million to below 350 ppm. But 350 is more than a number—it's a symbol of where we need to head as a planet.

350.org works hard to organize in a new way—everywhere at once, using online tools to facilitate strategic offline action. We want to be a laboratory for the best ways to strengthen the climate movement and catalyze transformation around the world. We believe that if a global grassroots movement holds our leaders accountable to realities of science and principles of justice, we can realize the solutions that will ensure a better future for all.

Or to put it another way...

With over 4000 languages spoken around the world, words don't always get the point across. To transcend the language barrier we made [this wordless animation that explains 350.org in 90 seconds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5kg1oOq9tY).

climatesecurity	climatesecurity	"Welcome to Climate Security

This subreddit is dedicated to discussing the impacts of a changing climate on regional, national and international security.

In order to enhance and maintain political and economic stability, human populations depend on a stable and predictable climate system to grow food, access fresh water, produce & transport energy and maintain critical infrastructure.  

As the climate changes, and populations are unable to adapt, access to these resources become increasingly illusive, which puts pressure on populations to seek desperate alternatives in order to survive.  Security & Stability are often strained in these cases.

These alternatives might include mass human migrations in search of food and water; military operations to secure vital energy resources in contested areas; or internal instability caused by extreme weather events.

How nations manage their own internal and external security from climate variability will increasingly fall within the purview of each nation's defense and intelligence establishments.

CollapseSurvival	Preparing for abrupt climate change, peak oil, and collapse of global industrialized civilization	"This subreddit was created to host useful discussions about collapse-aware prepping.

We have a limited time to prepare for an abrupt shift in Earth's climate, along with disruptions to the economic, energy, and social systems on which most of us currently rely.

We are [not far from our first ice free Arctic summer](http://iwantsomeproof.com/extimg/siv_annual_max_loss_and_ice_remaining.png).  This is troubling, considering [the physics of heating ice versus heating water](https://www.mwit.ac.th/~physicslab/hbase/thermo/imgheat/pha1.gif), along with feedbacks such as albedo changes and permafrost melt.

Societal collapse is possible in the wake of disruptions to our food supply.  And further climate destabilization is possible should global dimming abruptly stop.

Please refer to the parent sub of this subreddit, /r/collapse for news and discussion about the problems we face.  This sub is dedicated to prepping posts that address collapse risks.

askaconservative	Ask A Conservative: Ask Conservatives And Republicans Questions	"#[Ask a Conservative](/r/askaconservative)

This sub exists for users to ask conservatives questions about the [definition of conservatism](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative), Right-wing politics, conservative theory, traditional values, policy in conservatism, and conservative principles. 

**Only conservatives will answer those questions.** New conservatives, independents, libertarians, moderates, (polite) liberals and others can then engage in [Socratic dialogue](http://www.criticalthinking.org/pages/the-role-of-socratic-questioning-in-thinking-teaching-learning/522) in order to [understand and explore](http://www.socraticmethod.net/) [conservatism](https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateConservatives/wiki/conservatism).

This is not a sub for people to ""argue"" and ""debate"" in the debased manner as performed on [most of Reddit](https://www.gq.com/story/reddit-thread-ex-neckbeards-self-righteous-nerds) and other social media sites. Those shouting matches are not productive; we aim toward civil discussion of high quality, and we moderate to match.

## [Guidelines](http://web.archive.org/web/20190926171028/https://old.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/about/sidebar)

1. Follow [Reddit site-wide rules](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy/) and [etiquette](https://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette).
2. Contributions must be [civil](/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-civil), [fact/logic based](/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-factual), and [informative](/r/deep_ecology/wiki/rules-informative).
3. Contributions must fit our [standards for discussion](/r/askaconservative/comments/6npjbd/how_i_visualize_our_discussions/) and avoid [low effort postings](/r/essential/wiki/guidelines#wiki_3._no_low-quality.2Feffort_posts.2C_including_undescriptive_thread_titles.) and [low-quality sources](/r/askaconservative/wiki/conservative_news). 
4. Do not delete topics or comments. 
5. No drama. No meta topics in the sub; do not mention other subreddits or link them (/r/example) or invoke users (/u/example).
6. Our goal is a sub that [people can read like a magazine](https://www.reddit.com/r/askaconservative/wiki/discussion) and find high-quality informative content on the topic of *why* conservatives believe what they do.
7. [Rise above](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHR-rzUjCzU) the [Reddit](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=reddit) [lowest common denominator](http://thisinterestsme.com/things-hate-reddit/) keeping in mind [the Dunning-Kruger effect](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e320/9ca64cbed9a441e55568797cbd3683cf7f8c.pdf) and [the bell curve](https://www.thoughtco.com/introduction-to-the-bell-curve-3126337) mean [that](http://ieas.unideb.hu/admin/file_7421.pdf) there are [no universal truths, values, or communications](https://www.iep.utm.edu/nihilism/).
8. No [tone policing](https://www.thecrimson.com/column/millennial-athwart/article/2016/4/8/stop-tone-policing/) or [concern trolling](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=concern%20troll). Conservatism is a broad group that includes [mainstream Republicans](https://www.lifezette.com/), [paleoconservatives](https://www.conservapedia.com/index.php?title=Paleoconservative), [American New Right](https://www.britannica.com/topic/New-Right), [European New Right](https://theconversation.com/the-long-game-of-the-european-new-right-75078), [Old Right](https://penetrate.blogspot.com/2020/05/old-right.html), [crunchy cons](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/dreher/crunchy-cons-not-dead-yet/), [religious conservatives](http://www.gornahoor.net/), [log cabin Republicans](http://www.logcabin.org/), the [Alt-Right](http://www.amerika.org/politics/the-alt-right/), and [secular conservatives](http://secularright.org/).
9. No [astroturfing](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/astroturfing). You are speaking for conservatism here, not yourself. If you are [paid](http://thegoldwater.com/news/5176-Media-Matters-From-CTR-to-Shareblue-How-Paid-Shills-Attempt-to-Distort-the-Truth) to post here, you must acknowledge that; if you are a Leftist -- including [Libertarians](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3194162-one-gratifying-aspect-of-our-rise-to-some-prominence-is) -- do not [pretend](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/how-do-you-do-fellow-kids) to be conservative; if you also post in any sub that has violated Reddit rules (including [this list of subs](/r/askaconservative/wiki/brigades/) which have [brigaded](https://www.dailydot.com/news/week-reddit-downvote-brigades-business/) us in the past) you will be [banned](https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/turnip/harvesting-turnips.htm).
10. Do not come here to fight with conservatives, bicker over the latest [gotchas](https://www.thefreedictionary.com/gotchas) from late night comedy, or insert propaganda. We strongly suggest [steelmanning](https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Steel_man) any question or response.
11. The R. Lee Ermey rule: [""Here you are all equally *worthless*.""](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=78ICiQKdO-Q) In most subs, [you are the client](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/eternal-september); here, our [goal](https://www.history.com/news/the-zodiac-ciphers-what-we-know) is to [uphold Rule Six](https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/56966/speech-all-the-worlds-a-stage). Our mod staff includes two PhDs, an LLM, three MAs, and two MBAs and we [value their time](/r/askaconservative/wiki/moderation) over your trivial objections, [maggots](https://i.imgur.com/Nrw8ZtV.jpg).

If anything here shocks, confuses, offends, triggers, traumatizes, or disturbs you and you have self-destructive thoughts, please [consult this resource](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/get-help/immediate-help).

conservatives	conservatives	"Conservatism (from, conservare, ""to preserve"") is a political and social philosophy that promotes the maintenance of traditional institutions and supports minimal and gradual change in society.  Conservatives will also argue for reversal of change that has proven to be detrimental.

*****

Feel free to speak your mind, as a conservative, without fear of being banned.  If you are a concern troll, pretending to be conservative, you need to know that the US government has provided us with special detection gear... and we will find you out.  This is not a subreddit for you to try to infiltrate and there's an antenna and tin pie pan on our computers that will suss you out.  Non-conservatives may ask questions and engage in polite conversation with conservatives on a limited basis, but should avoid heated debate or downvoting based on opinion.   This is not, in fact, a debate subreddit... so if you are a liberal you are not welcome to constantly try to challenge conservatives here.  There are other subreddits where you may do that.

 Please do not use excessive profanity and heated rhetoric.

Rules:

1) Avoid personal attacks and insults.  

2) No identitarian hatred.  

3) Follow reddit terms of service... do not advocate or promote violence or doxx.

4) Do not link to other content on reddit where you are participating.  This is considered brigading.  If you came HERE because another subreddit featured us, linked to us or crossposted our content, do NOT comment or vote in this subreddit.

5) Do not make comments consisting entirely of leftist talking points.  Don't shill for leftist politicians. Do not make comments that bash conservatives.

6) If you are submitting an article, please pick a title that DESCRIBES the article if not the title given to it.  Do not submit articles promoting leftist politicians or leftist policies and thinking.

7) Direct meta complaints about the subreddit or submissions here to modmail.

spambotwatch	spambotwatch	"**Types of behaviors:**

 * Markov chain:  they will take portions of other comments in the thread, and chain them together, creating a new, often nonsensical comment.  See /r/subredditsimulator for examples.

 * Comment copy:  makes an identical comment that someone has already made.  The syntax will be identical.

 * Imgur comment copy:  makes an identical comment that someone has already made on Imgur.  The syntax will be identical.

 * Comment repost:  runs an image/gif through KarmaDecay.com and copies a comment from when it has been posted previously.  The syntax will be identical.

 * **New behaviors noticed**

 * Makes an identical comment that someone has already made on a YouTube video.  The syntax will be identical.

 * Submissions that have 1 word in the title which matches the subreddit's name, but are probably off topic.

**Explanation:**

https://www.reddit.com/r/catpranks/comments/41jmyf/cat_food_in_a_halloween_candy_bowl/cz3di38?context=4

**Rules**

 * Link directly to a profile.  This prevents more than one submission of the same account.

 * Don't downvote bot comments.  They delete the evidence when you do that.

 * Providing evidence of behavior in the comments section is encouraged but not required.

 * Make sure the account has at least 2 comments displaying bot behavior.  Sometimes people just copy Imgur comments because they're lazy.

**Why are we doing this?**

 * I dunno, maybe these guys will all show up in Ben Carson's AMA or something.

 * Really, though, not sure where to go from here.  Ideas?"
