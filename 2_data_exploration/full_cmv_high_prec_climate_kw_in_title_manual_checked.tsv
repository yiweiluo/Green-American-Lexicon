t3_pfj4cd	"CMV: There isn't a more immediate threat to the human race, that we are currently experiencing the effects of, than anthropogenic climate change."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This isn&#39;t a discussion about whether climate change is real or if humans are the cause, there&#39;s enough studies out there to prove it is. The scale of the impact it will have is up for debate, but seeing as Siberia is currently on fire (one of the coldest places on earth: <a href=""https://www.greenpeace.org/international/story/49171/russia-record-breaking-fires-siberia/"">link</a>) I&#39;m thinking it&#39;s a good time to discuss.
Assuming droughts, fires, floods and storms get worse along with an estimated <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/sep/09/climate-crisis-could-displace-12bn-people-by-2050-report-warns"">1.2bn people</a> being displaced in our lifetime. What other hotly debated issues are of a similar threat to the human race? </p>

<p>I learned recently about the Povolzhye famine. In 1921, Russian farmers were hit with severe drought and an unstable political climate. In less than 12 months there were reports of blackmarket trade in human flesh. People unwilling to give up their dead family members to authorities because it was their only source of nutrition. </p>

<p>Seeing that only 100 years ago it took 12 months for farmers to resort to cannibalism, I can&#39;t see the outlook being much better when there are droughts and food shortages on a global scale.</p>

<p>This is assuming the world doesn&#39;t get vaporised by aliens or we start a nuclear war tomorrow. My point being we are experiencing the effects of climate change now. We aren&#39;t currently experiencing a nuclear war or getting slapped by Galactus</p>

t3_f7u4jw	CMV: There is no viable free market solution to climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>According to the most recent reports we&#39;re already in a climate crisis. People are already protesting enmasse for drastic changes. The free market is not a system that handles drastic change well. If there is drastic change that fundamentally, and systematically shuts down certain types of businesses, and revenue streams the markets tend to go into free fall and crash. Still, we do need to change our ways in a fundamental and systemic way. So I don’t think there is a way you can come up with a free market solution that would adequately address the problem and still have a fully functioning free market.  I am open to ideas and would like to hear what you think.</p>

t3_7xb8xn	CMV: I’m not convinced climate change is caused primarily by mankind. Convince me.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>My opinion is that it could be. Please don’t resort to logical fallacies such as 97% of scientists confirm this(appeal to authority) or what not. It lends credence To the claim but does not prove it. Also don’t use arguments like it feels colder this year or there’s an anomaly this year where it was colder. This is about long term trends not year to year predictions. And the majority of the scientific community has been wrong before. The way I see it is climate and weather are one of the largest scale chaotic systems we attempt to study. It has so many variables that it has been proven that even a single butterfly could cause the difference between a hurricane happening and not. You know chaos theory and the like. Our models still give us only partially accurate short term weather predictions and climate change takes decades and has more unpredictable variables than weather. We can’t measure all of these at once though we can attempt to predict some of them because there are some variables that tend to be consistent(but not always) given that in order to predict climate change we have created climate algorithms where we assume a lot and make educated guesses about some of the variables and their coefficients. We’ve been wrong about weather a lot and are fairly consistently wrong about what the climate was going to be. So how can we be sure we’re right this time? Thanks in advance! </p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Ron/Rand Paul&#39;s brand of &quot;who are economists to run our country?&quot; populism is strangely popular on Reddit.

I&#39;ve never heard it from someone who has learned <em>any</em> economics from anywhere other than mises.org or reason.com, let alone has any actual qualification in the field.</p>

<p>Economists are almost entirely united on the topic of independent central banking being a good thing.  Those who care to look at the experiments could see what an irresponsibly tight central bank (the only central bank this group seems to approve of) did during the start of the Great Depression in the US, compared to the actions of, say, the Bank of England (until the disastrous decision to go back to gold in 1925).  Or you could look at the results of a neutered ECB (I think it was WaPo who called it &#39;the gold standard with moral authority&#39;) in Europe today.  Or how deflation put Japan in a coma for an entire (really more like two) decades.</p>

t3_an59pr	CMV: The most ethical course of action is to take very drastic measures to stop climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I briefly cite my premises:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Climate change is real (If I wanted to discuss this fact then my title would be different. I will not award deltas to people saying it is a conspiracy or a myth) and is mostly caused by humans as per IPCC and Stern Review (I will accept credible criticism of this claim). </p></li>
<li><p>As per IPCC&#39;s 1.5 Celsius report, published in late 2018, the damages of climate change are now unavoidable and we need to prepare for them. In the next 20 years we will see drastic weather conditions, loss of ecosystems and water stress <em>no matter what we do</em></p></li>
</ul>

<p>I have two arguments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Actual Generations vs. Future Generations</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>The actions we take today to fight climate change, however small, will influence the well being of ALL the generations to come. To make this a proper argument I&#39;ll put it in mathematical terms: unless there is a massive extinction of all humans, the generations to come are <em>virtually infinite</em>. Therefore, a marginal benefit for them would mean an infinite net benefit. A marginal damage to them would be an infinite net damage. It is ethical to take the most drastic actions possible right now to ensure no net damage.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Developed vs. Underdeveloeped: </li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Countries with high levels of development have the highest levels of emissions, which makes them the most responsible for the problem. At the same time, they also have the highest adaptability, which means that when the damages of climate change do come they will be able to mitigate the effects. In the mean time, underdeveloped countries have had the lowest emissions, making them the least responsible, and will be the ones to suffer the most. Island states ─ like Tuvalu, which has already begun evacuating due to the rising sea-level ─ and arid states such as those in Sub-Saharan Africa will be the most affected while also being the ones that contributed to the problem the least.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My conclusion, which I intend to change by starting this discussion:</p>

<ul>
<li>The most ethical course of action is to take extremely drastic measures to reduce the plastic pollution and green house gas emissions. No matter what the cost is, it is of the utmost necessity that all developed nations and all contemporary generations be pushed into a draconian regime of environment conservationism.</li>
</ul>

<p>By stating my conclusion in this way I am willful opening my reasoning to a line of critique: maybe such drastic action would be more costly than a more moderate action. So far, the evidence I&#39;ve found points to the contrary, but I&#39;m willing to open up my perspective in this respect.</p>

<p>The only reservation I have in this discussion is that I will not admit unfounded arguments saying that climate change is a conspiracy or a myth. I will consider any and all evidence regarding other points, but will not respond to claims that there is no climate change.</p>

<p>Thank you very much in advance, and thanks for reading this.</p>

t3_6bko5w	CMV: by the time climate change becomes an imminent threat technology will have advanced enough to eliminate the threat	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First a couple clarifications: </p>

<p>Edit: My original definition of threat may be oversimplified. That&#39;s intentional. The point of the post isn&#39;t to debate whether climate change exists, or whether we should do something about it, or where it should be on the global priority list, but rather will the pace of technological innovation halt/reverse/fix it before it&#39;s apocalyptic. Many responses are pointing out the flaw in my definition while ignoring the overall point of the post. </p>

<p><strong>Imminent Threat:</strong> People are actually dying or expected to within a couple years. We can argue forever on what constitutes &quot;imminent&quot; but the reality is nobody is dying today because of climate change. Also, let&#39;s not derail the discussion by arguing that weather is more severe, and therefore killing people, or food is harder to grow but we can still do it, etc. I&#39;m talking direct alien-invasion style threat to humanity.</p>

<p><strong>!= Destroy the Planet:</strong> I also think cancer will be cured within my lifetime but I&#39;m not going to start smoking. My view isn&#39;t <em>we&#39;ll fix it so we can do whatever we want now</em>.  I&#39;m sure it&#39;d be easier to &quot;fix&quot; something that&#39;s less broken, but that&#39;s not my point here.</p>

<p>So reddit,</p>

<p>Technology in every sector is advancing incredibly quickly. We have solutions to problems we didn&#39;t even know we had a decade ago. We have cures/treatments for diseases that used to be a death sentence. We can build pretty much everything bigger, faster, stronger, safer, more reliable. We&#39;ve found galaxies and have plans to send human beings to Mars.</p>

<p>We&#39;re incredibly young, but our knowledge is growing exponentially. Depending on which definition you use, humans have been <a href=""http://science.howstuffworks.com/first-scientist.htm"">doing science</a> for 500-3,000 years. I have no exact statistics, but someone could make a compelling argument that what we&#39;ve learned in the last century is equal to or greater than the previous 400-2900 years. </p>

<p>There&#39;s no reason to believe we&#39;ll stop learning anytime soon and the disastrous threats of climate change are still a while off. Before that time comes, we&#39;ll have the technology, tools, whatever needed to either &quot;fix&quot; climate change or live on a hotter planet.</p>

<p>I have no idea what that &quot;thing&quot; is ... maybe a huge pair of sunglasses we put in space, or CO2-eating robots, or we&#39;ll move the planet further away from the sun. Whatever it is though, we&#39;ll have figured it out.</p>

t3_2cuion	CMV: I don't believe climate change is happening.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>To clarify, I don&#39;t believe the World&#39;s climate is static and unchanging, I just don&#39;t think it is nearly as dramatic as the media says. I dispute any major warming in recent times, and believe the whole climate change agenda is simply environmental lobbyists backed by politicians who can no longer refute the issue and still maintain their credibility. I used to be into the scientific side of it a lot, but I haven&#39;t for a while, although I will be corresponding with a mate of mine who is of the same opinion as me who is knowledgeable in the science. </p>

<p>I have a fundamental distrust of most of the media in Australia (where I live), but I can&#39;t comment on the American media. I think it would be political suicide for any politician considering climate change &#39;denialists&#39; are being hounded down by pretty much everyone. </p>

<p>Skepticism and opposition to conventional scientific thinking is only a good thing, and I think the extent to which any skepticism of climate change is disregarded is appalling. </p>

t3_5o6e8f	CMV: Some of (if not all) the worst outcomes for climate change are inevitable given our geopolitical structure	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We have a global economy that is incredibly dependent on industrial processes that produce carbon and we do know that carbon is a contributor to the process of climate change. The process of putting carbon into the atmosphere is, in my view, a runaway process that has too much momentum to be stopped before we pass into a danger zone.</p>

<p>Even if tomorrow everyone in the US smashed their cars, shut down coal power plants, stopped using plastic at all, and basically went carbon neutral, we still have the rest of the world.</p>

<p>Developing countries utilize &quot;dirty&quot; forms of production because these methods are more economically effective in their particular circumstances. Unless more developed countries are willing to essentially gift solar power plants and electric trains, most of these places won&#39;t be able to afford this kind of &quot;green&quot; infrastructure. </p>

<p>The political will to make less carbon producing methods of production available freely to the places that need it is not there and it will not be there until it&#39;s too late. </p>

<p>Especially now considering the US, the country with probably the best chance of getting things done, will shortly have an administration that refuses to acknowledge that climate change is even happening.</p>

<p>Large sectors of private capital have a vested interest in not responding to the problem of climate change and can levy considerable power to stop initiatives to address the problem.</p>

<p>Putting all these together I really don&#39;t see a way for our political systems to be able to work together in the way that is necessary to address the problem of climate change in a timeframe that will allow us to avoid serious problems.</p>

<p>Now, this is obviously depressing as hell and I&#39;d like to be wrong about it but so far I&#39;m not seeing much to the contrary.</p>

<p>CMV, please.</p>

<p>I believe climate change is happening. I believe there is a obvious trend line showing that the earth is slowly warming up. However, I do not believe that there is any evidence humanity is the main cause. Since humanity is part of the ecosystem on our planet it of course has an impact but its imho a far stretch to say humanity is the leading cause.</p>

<p>Ok, lets get on with it. Why I dont believe humans are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<ol>
<li>Many factors influence climate change</li>
<li>Chaos theory dictates that small changes in the factors can have huge impact</li>
<li>Who is to say that climate change isnt the cause of a butterfly in South Africa flapping its wings, solar flares or cow farts?</li>
</ol>

<p>In my opinion since we cannot have a controlled experiment with a earth exactly as it is now but without humans we cant say that humans are the main cause of climate change.</p>

<p>Im aware that most scientists dont agree with this. What im hoping to get from this CMV is a sort of ELI5 which explains to me why chaos theory doesnt apply here.</p>

<p>Increasing population of third world countries (even if their population growth rate decreasing, even if they have smaller consumption and emissions per capita than western countries) presents existential threat to Earth and western civilisation.</p>

<p>Radically reducing human population will greatly slow down global warming to the point where we can start implementing real working solutions to completely stop it, it will allow Earth ecosystems to regenerate, and as bonus it&#39;ll also save European and other northern and some southern countries from being overrun. </p>

t3_ppqrgn	CMV: Nuclear energy is a viable tool to revert climate change and stop the world's heavy fossil fuel addiction	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I totally get that nuclear power isn&#39;t ideal and it does have its flaws, but as I see most concerns with it can be solved: that it produces radioactive waste, that there have been some ugly nuclear disasters in history, that supposedly it can be used to develop nuclear weapons and that it is freaking expensive. To each of these issues, I counter: the waste problem could be eased, today there are low-waste generating reactors and anyways radioactive waste still is less worse than an out-of-control warming and dying world; the risk of nuclear disasters could be highly reduced with today&#39;s tech, most nuclear reactors in operation were built in the 80&#39;s and have outdated technology, and besides, taken in comparison with coal alone, nuclear haven&#39;t had nearly as many death tolls as it is portrayed by the media. It&#39;s just that when it happens with nuclear, it actually doesn&#39;t look pretty; so many countries already have nuclear weapons, with or without nuclear energy. So it isn&#39;t necessarily nuclear energy technology fault, maybe more so a problem with war being hugely profitable and incentivized in capitalism; what is more expensive, working at reducing carbon emissions now or trying to fix the impacts of a 2°C degrees warmer world?</p>

<p>Ok, so far so good, but now, however, there is one flaw I&#39;m not entirely able to reason against, and I shouldn&#39;t, because I totally agree with, which is: Nuclear requires total centralization of power. And centralization of power in my opinion is one of the major reasons behind our civilizational crisis.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, I don&#39;t think this is enough to completely abandon the technology for good. But see, what I&#39;m saying is not that we shouldn&#39;t try and go renewables, solar and wind. We totally should and I think it is the best way, but at this point it seems very unlikely the whole world will be able to make a full transition in time to revert the worst of climate change (about 7 years left hey), so anything that can be done to help should be done, and for that reason it comes to me as totally unreasonable what some countries like Germany are doing, phasing-out all of their nuclear reactors! Just when we should be investing in new cutting-edge ones... Well, unless the money from those are going to pour straight into solar investments, which I highly doubt. It&#39;s going to dirty coal! With its decentralized nature, the government can&#39;t profit as much from solar. I believe solar is the solution, solar is for the win, and though I&#39;m an idealist, I&#39;m still sensible enough to see that in the short-term a strictly solar civilization is as utopic as wishing for a stateless one, perhaps in a post-scarcity future, but for now, why not build a solar-nuclear world?</p>

<p>So guys, I&#39;m ready, prove me wrong! As a young adult in his 20s expecting to live a reasonable life in this crazy century, I&#39;m deeply interested in solving society&#39;s energy crisis and I want to have new views on this matter.</p>

t3_38d9or	"CMV: Global warming predictions are epistemologically flawed, and should not be the basis for public policy."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>There have been lots of global warming CMVs before, but I think my objection is more specific and has not yet been addressed. This is not &quot;please explain global warming to me&quot;.</p>

<p>I do believe in the greenhouse effect, I do believe it&#39;s possible for humans to change the atmosphere. My belief is that <strong>scientific prediction around global warming is so politically charged it is not reliable and should not be trusted.</strong></p>

<p>Predictions for global climate change are based on computerized models. All the catastrophic predictions for global warming assume some feedback loop whereby continued increases in CO2 trigger another effect which then leads to runaway warming. Change a few assumptions about those feedback loops (e.g. how much sunlight is reflected back by cloud cover) and suddenly the predictions for warming are moderate and not catastrophic at all.</p>

<p>What do I mean by epistemologically flawed? In order for science to be objective, <strong>scientific claims must be falsifiable, and there also must be a reward or incentive for scientists to do studies which falsify them.</strong> </p>

<p>In most scientific fields (e.g. physics, astronomy) if you perform a great study which upsets the currently held theory you become famous and everyone cites you.</p>

<p>If a great new model comes out which shows little-to-no warming, or that the effects of warming are positive, it would be unpublishable in a top journal. Even more to the point, it would be unfundable. Research grants from the federal government or major research universities would not flow to scientists who find contrary findings to the mainstream, so those results are never found, or when they are found, researchers have an incentive to tamper with their model until it gives desired predictions.</p>

<p>The problem is that the government which issues grants is the same entity which gains enormous regulatory power based on the predictions of climate research. Politicians get votes by pointing to huge problems and promising to solve them. &quot;Things are basically fine&quot; is not a sellable platform in a democracy. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s a closed feedback loop: </p>

<p>government funds climate research --&gt; </p>

<p>finds catastrophic warming --&gt; </p>

<p>people vote more money and power to the government --&gt; </p>

<p>more money for climate science.</p>

<p>But <strong>97% of climate scientists agree!</strong> Well, 97% of the ones who can get published do. More to the point, if you have an interest in climate science, it&#39;s probably because you think something should be done about it, otherwise why are you interested? Plus climate change is sexy and gets you access to the halls of power. There&#39;s a selection effect among scientists, in addition to the incentive effect described above.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t a conspiracy, by the way. It&#39;s just the way that incentives happen to run within climate science, which is not present in really any other branch of science except maybe some economics - but people are much more willing to accept an appeal to authority on climate science, which appears more objective and out of their everyday experience than economics.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR: Climate change isn&#39;t falsifiable because there&#39;s no incentive given to falsify it, so its predictions should not be trusted.</strong></p>

<p><strong>What could change my view:</strong></p>

<p>I know this belief puts me out of the mainstream and I&#39;d like a good reason to change it. Thanks in advance!</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I did not expect this post to generate so much interest. I&#39;ve been trying to reply to everyone but this is quickly spiraling out of my control. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 2</strong>: Some deltas awarded. I still think my criticism of the funding mechanism for global warming studies is valid. The problem is that this causes catastrophic predictions to get more notice, while moderate opinions are shouted down as climate-deniers. </p>

<p><strong>EDIT 3</strong>: I&#39;m slowing down here, thanks for your interest! I&#39;ll still check back and award deltas to people who hit the points I listed above, but I can&#39;t possibly respond to every post at this point, apologies. Appreciate the (mostly) very thoughtful debate, and I did read every post, even if I didn&#39;t reply.</p>

<p><strong>Last Edit:</strong> View officially changed. <a href=""/u/myncknm"">/u/myncknm</a> gives examples of measured and conservative papers on climate change, which do not fit my prediction of politically-influenced alarmism. I have to change my view. Learned a lot, and I would also encourage those who believe in rampant or runaway warming to take a look at those sources.</p>

t3_bx9qvh	CMV: Climate change cannot end human civilization.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Life on earth has survived many cycles of climate change far more severe, with higher atmospheric carbon, than the worst predictions. I concede concern for the speed at which we are changing the climate, but nothing has come close to reducing my faith in the resiliency of nature, and of humanity. </p>

<p>There will be many more extinctions, entire ecosystems will collapse. But new ecosystems will rise. There may be less diversity in nature, but the niches will be filled sure as the sun will rise. Maybe we&#39;ll eat a lot more squid and a lot less fish, and do a lot more hydroponics than irrigated landscapes, but none of that is civilization ending.</p>

<p>We survived an ice age without the benefits of modern technology, now that we have all these tools and information there&#39;s no way we won&#39;t survive the next one. Humans are on the verge of interplanetary colonization. If we can learn to survive in the void of space, or on a planet totally inhospitable to life, surely we&#39;ll adapt to our own planet growing marginally less inhabitable.</p>

t3_943u93	CMV: It's too late. Climate change or Global Warming will doom humanity and maybe all life on earth to extinction at the start of the next century and there is nothing we can do to prevent it.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Earlier today I was going through a thread on <a href=""/r/AskReddit"">/r/AskReddit</a> about things people aren&#39;t taking seriously enough and one that stood out to me was when one answered Global Warming. I have not thought about climate change for a long time and have often tried to ignore it, but the replies to that comment made me feel a bit, well, anxious to say the least. They were going on about how most people were ignorant and that we should all be scared because we were going to die out in a few decades. Now most people after reading that would have simply moved on while feeling spooked at most, but I am not most people. And not in a good way.</p>

<p>I should point out that I am 21 years old and a member of the Autism spectrum and thus I am extremely gullible and sensitive, and I have a big problem with obsessive thoughts. Things that have majorly contributed to my depression and anxiety. </p>

<p>But anyway, due to my aforementioned problem of obsessive thoughts I decided to read some more about the dangers of climate change after that thread and whether it&#39;s really that bad for future generations and one of the first things I found was an infamous article from New York Times called &quot;The Uninhabitable Earth&quot; that dealt with a possible future for earth and well...</p>

<p>...in case it wasn&#39;t obvious, I am terrified. I don&#39;t think I have been this scared in my entire life since the whole 2012 debacle in which despite all of the evidence to the contrary, I was still terrified of an impending doom. But this is something more real, something that has an actual scientific backing and is caused by us. For hours today, I have been going online through countless articles and comment thread hoping to find something that could ease my nerves. I managed to find a couple articles showing some scientists being optimistic about our future and a single article about an 80 something-year-old climate scientist saying it was hopeless to fight it and that we should basically prepare for what is essentially the end of the world. I also found some articles claiming that the NYT article was a flawed and exaggerated fearmongering, but then realized that these debunkers could be wrong.</p>

<p>But the bottom line is, </p>

<p>I think it&#39;s hopeless. There is no chance a couple of hundreds or even millions of people can convince these companies that are pumping out these gasses to stop because of their greed, and even if we magically managed to do it, it is already too late. We have passed the point of no return and in a hundred years, the earth will be to unhospitable and life here will cease to exist while the universe barely notices. The worst part is that I will possibly be alive to witness the beginning of the catastrophe that will follow and just stand helpless while knowing that the next generations will burn to a crisp in burning hell while everyone else is sunbathing in the heat and not noticing until they have started to burn.</p>

<p>I am scared, and for one of the few moments of my life, I hope I am wrong. I WANT to be proven wrong. NOW I AM NOT asking for proof against climate change. It&#39;s happening, it&#39;s man-made and it&#39;s been proven true. What I want to do is see if anyone has any compelling evidence of proof that it won&#39;t BE AS catastrophic as I believe. That humanity and life, in general, will be able to thrive for centuries to come, but unfortunately, that feels too unrealistic to me with the path we are currently heading...</p>

<p>TL:DR </p>

<p>Just read the title.</p>

<p>Climate change is real and I believe that it will wipe out life on earth in a century, and there is nothing we can do to stop it.</p>

<p>Wind and solar power are great but nuclear power is more reliable and produces far more power.  Chernobyl and Three Mile Island and Fukushima are cautionary lessons about safety, but they are not arguments for giving up on nuclear power altogether, not when global warming, like a fire, is accelerating and almost no time is left to act.</p>

<p><strong>Edit</strong>: I did not say that we should only use nuclear power to address global warming.  Rather, without nuclear power we are doomed, and the table should not be artificially tilted towards non-nuclear solutions.</p>

t3_db1s7k	CMV: Climate change is meaningless and worrying about it is incredibly stupid	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>[removed]</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_bz4ok8	CMV: The Anti-Humanist/nihilist aspect of the climate change debate pushes more people into denialism that it does acceptance.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m going to preface this by saying that I believe that humans are accelerating climate change
via the use of fossil fuels. This will ultimately be detrimental and cause huge issues in the near future.
That is my personal position on the issue.</p>

<p>Here comes the BUT...</p>

<p>The climate change debate is too often getting twisted into an anti-humanist one and ultimately a nihilistic one.
Basically, that human existence is the issue, not an issue with resource usage or allocation. </p>

<p>This is characterized in two main ways. An argument that heavily, implies that humanity doesn&#39;t deserve
to exist. That humanity might even be morally reprehensible. And the second is that the only way to really change human behavior is by force and authoritarian means.</p>

<p>I will try to present these arguments in the form that I have seen them, and then offer up my rebuttal.</p>

<p>The first argument often made is that there is a clear distinction made between the planet
and human beings as a whole. </p>

<p>This often leads to the conclusion that humans are like a virus that is infecting the Earth.
Or that Earth is a separate entity with it&#39;s own agency that has a goal to maintain some perceived natural purity. </p>

<p>This to me can only really be interpreted as a nihilistic argument. It&#39;s fundamentally incorrect. Earth is a complex system in which
humans are inherently a part of. They are not separate. Most worrisome though is that implies that the earth is against us. Or even that
earth has the means to be for or against something. That it has goals that are in direct conflict with human kind. (I refer you to George Carlin bit on saving the planet as a funny take of this argument).
It is an anti human and pro earth argument. Even though the very concept of being pro earth is bizarre.</p>

<p>The second is that overpopulation is the primary issue. This argument has merits, since more people obviously
equates to more resource consumption. However, the implied solution to the issue is problematic.
We must depopulate. How do you do this? Well this argument often leads to the final argument.</p>

<p>The final argument that human society is the issue. Now this is obviously a nuanced argument which has a lot of truth to it.
However, the nihilistic and anti humanist position is that human behavior must change, but this change must be done by force or authoritarian means.
Fundamentally, they do not believe human&#39;s ability to change via their own volition.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, on bad days I can see how they reach this conclusion. But it&#39;s lazy and historically shown to be dangerous.
My gut response to this is that if humanity has to be saved by removing essentially what it is that makes us human, our own agency, then we haven&#39;t really saved anyone.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear to me that if the climate change argument is presented as the points above, someone hearing the climate change debate for the first time will have a strong incentive to turn away and dismiss it.
Accepting it means accepting that humanity doesn&#39;t deserve to live on earth, and that the only solution is to actually take away the very thing that makes us human.</p>

<p>I understand these views are radical and are presented by a minority, but it is often the radical, minority position you hear first on a topic you don&#39;t know much about. This argument will push many people way simply on principle.</p>

<p>None of this is a justification for remaining scientifically illiterate or ignoring the effects of man made climate change.</p>

<p>I want finish my argument by making a case for humanity and that essentially we have only known about our wide scale effect on the climate for the last 60 - 70 years. That is such a short blip of time. 
Just think about the progress we&#39;ve made in that time and then compare that to the magnitude of the problem.
The problem involves fundamentally changing industries, markets, and the minds of billions of people about our effect on an insanely complex ecological system. The complexity in that is staggering. And all of this has to be done without collapsing the very fragile system we live in.</p>

<p>And yeah, maybe we aren&#39;t exactly where we need to be and that there has been setbacks, and we could be doing better, but we have to remember that humans never intentionally did this. Nobody knew about the effects we would have on the global climate when they started burning coal. It is, at its core, a blameless problem, and we have to be careful we don&#39;t actually blame the concept of humanity itself.</p>

t3_bd2zne	CMV: Nothing I can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Hello! I&#39;m writing this because this is a rather pessimistic stance, and I really hope someone can change my mind.</p>

<p>I think that, for some reason, people seem to enjoy antagonizing themselves. <em>We</em> are the ones causing climate change. <em>We</em> are the ones killing the polar bears and walruses and penguins. <em>We</em> are the reason why plastic is in the ocean, and why  the rain forest is depleting.</p>

<p>But I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an individual issue. If I were to cut out meat entirely, stop purchasing anything made of palm oil, only ever bike to school, and never purchase anything made of plastic or with plastic packaging, climate change would still be happening. It might help slightly, but not in the long run. I am only one person. People say that everyone&#39;s actions will add up, but I don&#39;t think that many people will ever sacrifice their current lives to save our planet&#39;s future.</p>

<p>100 companies alone are responsible for <em>71 percent</em> of global carbon emissions. This shows that pollution is caused primarily by companies and corporations, not by &#39;little&#39; people like you (probably) or me. Sure, if <em>everyone</em> stopped buying Toyota cars, they&#39;d probably stop/reduce their emissions of carbon and drop off the list. But I think it&#39;s rather impossible to get everyone on board for that. They will keep contributing to climate change whether they have 10 million customers or 9 million, or even just 1 million.</p>

<p>Keep America Beautiful is a good example of where my opinion lies. KAB was created in the 50&#39;s by people like the Pepsi and Coca-Cola CEOs. They&#39;re the ones that coined the term &#39;litterbug&#39; and fund beach clean-ups and similar events. I think this is rather despicable, really; rather than taking responsibility for the huge amount of plastic they manufacture with, they shift all blame to individuals like you or me. Why should a bunch of people like us have to clean up the ocean for KAB due to a problem almost entirely instigated by KAB?</p>

<p>A last thing I wanted to touch on--the self antagonizing stuff is especially bad for those of low incomes. Even if I wanted to cut out plastic and stuff entirely, I, along with what I&#39;d argue to be most Americans, couldn&#39;t afford to. Eco-friendly products are typically much more expensive than standard ones. Cotton clothing is often much more expensive than clothing made of polyester.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think that using an LED bulb rather than fluorescent, or skipping a shower every other day, or boycotting everything made of palm oil is really going to do anything. This mentality is harmful not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting is a good start to solve these issues--holding politicians accountable for keeping companies, corporations, and net carbon emissions in check--but I cannot yet vote, hence the title &quot;nothing I can do.&quot; Overall, though, I think the solution isn&#39;t for us to take responsibility, but for those with power to hold corporations and companies responsible. Please change my view! And if there <em>is</em> something I can do that meaningfully impacts climate change, please share that with me!</p>

<p>EDIT: Woah, thanks so much for all the insightful comments and great discussion! I&#39;ve never had a CMV or post like this, and I really appreciate all of the conversation! Right now, thanks to you all, I&#39;ve changed my view to something like: it&#39;s good to strive to act environmentally-friendly via recycling, conserving energy, etc, as it&#39;s the moral thing to do, and one&#39;s actions may influence others. Alone, nothing I can do will meaningfully contribute to ending climate change and pollution or create a long-term change. However, by acting as a unit with others and placing pressure on others, a larger impact may be made. Framing climate change as solely an individual issue is still harmful, not only for antagonizing people with low incomes, but for shifting blame off companies and onto average people. Voting and lobbying are perhaps the best ways to combat climate change at this point. That, and not having kids.</p>

<p>I didn&#39;t expect this many comments and I have homework to do so it might take me a while, but I&#39;ll try to reply to everyone. Thanks!</p>

t3_243ke4	CMV: I think it's ethical to lie when assessing global warming and potential effects on human civilization	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Scientific community has reached some consensus about the following ideas:
1) climate change is happening
2) climate change is partly or mostly caused by human civilization (and thus can be slowed or reversed, in principle)
3) climate change can have damaging effects on human civilization, including potential loss of life in the near future.
Third point is the most controversial and politicians tend to make wrong choices - their point of view is often black and white: either they negate climate change, thus applying poor &quot;business as usual&quot; strategies, or paint themselves as paladins of environment, advocating use of resources for ineffective, overly-cautious strategies.
My point is: if climate change is caused by humans, and if it presents some risks for human civilization, then a flexible strategy should be employed to maximize efficient use of resources and minimize said negative effects. Unfortunately, the majority of people is scientific illiterate and cannot be easily convinced to support such strategies, because they invariably involve some sacrifice here and now.
Researchers try to be honest, and say things like &quot;there is a small but significant chance that ocean level will raise and destroy Bangladesh as we know it. The risk is, let&#39;s say, 4% in 100 years&quot; Reality is, we will not act on it even if acting would be logical and sound from an economic point of view alone. 
Sure, we should improve education first, but it&#39;s not a fast process and in the meanwhile Bangladesh is at risk. Real lives, real humans are going to suffer if we do not act.
So I think it&#39;s ethical to lie, exaggerating potential risks, to force the public opinion in the right direction, as fast as necessary to implement the most effective strategies. The end justifies the means. I am a logical person myself, I have an education in engineering and physics, I value the truth, I recognize that lies can have a damaging effects in the long term. Still I cannot think any other way to accomplish the same result. CMV.</p>

t3_2aovqi	CMV: I believe that GM food is proven to be safe and is necessary to stop global warming and organic farming should be discouraged.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>How GM food lessens global warming: </p>

<p>The efficiency of GM crops is world&#39;s ahead of organic farming, and thus, as long as the majority of farm operations and logistics is not powered by renewable energy, all non-GM farming increases global warming (97% of climate scientists believe humans are increasing global warming) </p>

<p><a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/"">NASA cites 97% of climate scientists say global warming is due to human activity</a>.</p>

<p>Non-GM, organic farming is much less efficient and the difference in efficiency is mainly powered by releasing carbon and other greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere, leading to more global warming. </p>

<p>Ways in which GM farming is more efficient than organic farming: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Amount of land used, which type of land can be used, which climates can be grown in, nutritional benefits v. unmodified GMO--all of these lead to efficiencies in the amount of land needed, amount of irrigation needed, amount of fertilizer/pesticides needed, distances needed to harvest, distances needed to bring to necessary population, etc., that directly impact global warming.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Because we are already slated to miss climate change targets by a huge amount, we cannot afford more organic farming while population, energy demands, and human food needs increase.</p>

t3_av20wh	CMV: Trying to stop climate change is a pointless effort.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I’ve taken a pretty fatalistic approach to climate change, for multiple reasons. </p>

<p>First off, a lot of damage has already been done. Humanity sealed its fate the second it moved its societal reach from hunter gatherer to agriculture and broke off from what nature intended humanity to be. It’s an inevitability that a bunch of animals with very little idea of how the world works would not recognize the unintended consequences of creating a bunch of synthetic artificial stuff that goes way beyond what nature provides. In other words, humanity is going against the grain of the world, and as such we end up hurting it in the process. So there’s probably some unintended consequence for the planet if we were to start using reusable resources. There’s always consequences, so we will start hurting the world in some other way.</p>

<p>Then let’s look at the monumental task of actually getting people to go green. First off, it’s incredibly hard to get someone to stop doing something they enjoy, especially if it’s for a cause they really don’t hardcore feel the effects of right now. Second, with the advent of the internet, conspiracy theories will be a lot more widespread and have a greater impact, so you will already have opposition. Finally, America isn’t the sole contributor to climate change, or even the largest. Places like China make the U.S. look incredibly environmentally friendly, with their smog filled streets and millions upon millions of cars. So now you have to convince millions of Chinese people that climate change is a problem and to start going green, from a foreign country. All I can say is, good luck. </p>

<p>Finally, the root of all evil, money. Unless you can find a better, cheaper, alternative that just more environmentally friendly, you aren’t going to solve it. Most people aren’t made of money, and it’s pretty condescending to think they’ll start spending more just for “the planet”. Climate Change is more of an idea than a necessity for people in general, unlike getting food on the table. </p>

<p>And in any case people will find a way to end the world much quicker than nature ever will. There will probably be some nuclear war over resources and everyone will die anyways before climate change ends up killing everyone. </p>

<p>Or maybe humanity will innovate their way out of this, since that’s the only way I really see climate change ever stopping. Either way, we aren’t going to solve this by recycling or walking to work. </p>

t3_5apx4k	"CMV: Donald Trump's belief that global climate change is a hoax should be enough of a reason to vote against him, regardless of what you think of his opponents."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Regardless of foreign policy experience, domestic policy agendas, or any outstanding scandals or political gaffes, this single issue should be at the top of everyone&#39;s list when comparing the presidential candidates. The fact that Trump has repeatedly denied the reality of climate change, even going so far as to claim it was fabricated by China, should be enough to disqualify him from earning your vote. </p>

<p>To put it another (more expansive) way, it is our responsibility as voters to automatically reject any candidate for public office who holds such a belief.</p>

t3_b65ulf	CMV: Having children is not a good solution to climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>On Tuesday, Senator Mike Lee of Utah spoke in opposition to the Green New Deal bill, saying of climate change that &quot;the solution to so many of our problems, at all times and in all places, is to fall in love, get married and have some kids.&quot; (<a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/2019/03/26/politics/mike-lee-green-new-deal/index.html"">source</a>)</p>

<p>His explanation of this argument is that a larger population will lead to more creativity and innovation, which will provide better engineering solutions to climate change. In his words, &quot;More people mean bigger markets for more innovation. More babies mean forward-looking adults, the sort we need to tackle long-term, large-scale problems.&quot;</p>

<p>I assert that he is wrong. Having children is not a good solution to climate change. Having children will directly put more stress on ecological systems and resources. Senator Lee&#39;s argument that a larger population will lead to more innovation is a weak one, because the overwhelming majority of people don&#39;t work in the scientific and technological fields that might produce more technological solutions to climate change. I am not convinced that the increased green-energy-related innovation from a larger population would be significant enough to offset the increased CO2 emissions and other ecological stresses that would also accompany population growth. </p>

<p>I invite you to change my mind.</p>

t3_e0du1x	CMV: Climate change will not end the world within the next 100years	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I’ve seen the idea that the world is gonna end soon due to climate change we’ll supported on reddit a lot and I’d be interested in seeing evidence of this. There are to my knowledge 4 major effects of climate change: sea levels rising, global warming, mass extinction and air pollution. Sea levels rising definitely will not make this planet inhospitable time humans, by the end of the century it’s supposed to rise about a meter and though that may cause some flooding in places really close to the coast it’s just a small obstacle. In the big picture global warming will greatly harm sea and animal life but for humans it will only be a nuisance, the only non-agricultural plants we need are trees and algae to produce oxygen, both especially algae are shown to thrive in higher co2 and though the weather will get more extreme this will sure not be the end of human civilization. Mass extinction is one of the worst, directly stemming from all the issues but even though it may be completely disastrous to animals worldwide in the human-centric view of the world ending it will do just about nothing, the only life we need can be easily taken care of or are actually doing better in this time as previously mentioned; though we want many animals to stay alive we don’t actually need them. Finally air pollution is in my knowledge the biggest concern for humanity but won’t be a world ender the air quality related deaths are predicted to go much higher but EPA or other agencies could probably curb the release of pollutants until it becomes a apocalypse in the far future, even in a world with deadly air there are many short term survival solutions like filtering gas masks and airlocked buildings.

t3_f8o7wa	CMV: Climate Change is real	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I recently read a quote by Charlie Munger about how, if you believe something, you should be able to argue against it extremely well to test your beliefs. This is what inspired me to make this post. I have always been brought up being told that climate change is a real as a result of the liberal environment in which I grew up. Thus I think it’ll be interesting hearing opposing views on the subject.</p>

<p>The reason I chose climate change in particular is partially because of all the anti-eco movement backlash that has crept up in recent years. All those attacks against Greta Thunberg, etc. But also because I guess on some fundamental level I want to believe climate change isn’t happening just out of fear and hope.</p>

<p>Sorry if I extended but I had to make the 500 word character limit.</p>

t3_999yxo	CMV: There is no way for the people who care about climate change to compensate for the people who don't.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I would be thrilled to be wrong about this. </p>

<p>I believe that as we keep seeing warming effects that line up with more pessimistic models than the IPCC emphasized, we are likely already locked in for over 2 degrees of warning, and with the actions of Trump, possibly up to 5 or more by 2100. This would certainly end civilization and possibly kill all humans. I expect geopolitical disasters from the effects of migration to start even before the really awful flooding and drought, and think anyone under 50 has a good chance of a bad death (starvation,  violence, dehydration, etc.)</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s too late to convince the unconvinced, and they likely will attribute the coming disasters to God&#39;s wrath, cheering the coal industry all the while.</p>

<p>The only hope I can think of would be if those of us who believe in the seriousness of the problem and are willing to sacrifice could somehow compensate for those who aren&#39;t. </p>

<p>This would mean we would have to become carbon <em>negative</em>, not just neutral. We&#39;d have to be carbon neutral ourselves, and then soak up enough carbon to compensate for about two other people. </p>

<p>I want this to be possible, but I can&#39;t think of a way that it could be. Carbon capture technology is not good enough yet, and trees (which only help in warmer climates anyway) don&#39;t grow fast enough, for us to be able to take enough carbon out of the atmosphere. Converting lawn and asphalt space to fast growing biomass like bamboo would present logistical and environmental challenges and likely couldn&#39;t do enough. Some kind of hydroponic system in buildings also presents too many logistical challenges. This is of course in addition to the necessary reduction in carbon emissions to zero, which itself would require major lifestyle changes that most people could not bear. </p>

<p>To change my view, you&#39;d have to offer a way that about 30% of the US population could, without the help of the federal government and mostly through private actions, compensate for the other 70%--about 30% apathetic types who believe in climate change but don&#39;t think it&#39;s a big deal/aren&#39;t willing to sacrifice anything major to stop it, and 40% lost cause denialists. (Any model that could work in the US would likely work everywhere else, because literally every other country cares more about the issue.) </p>

<p>Even if a model required bizarre and extreme actions, like living in weird communes and eating only wild berries, I&#39;d consider my view changed. </p>

<p>Note: you <em>won&#39;t</em> change my view with an argument that climate change isn&#39;t happening, isn&#39;t a big deal, or isn&#39;t caused by humans. The science is clear on those questions and it&#39;s too late for those arguments.</p>

<p>Change my view, please! I want grandchildren and I&#39;d rather not die in a wildfire.</p>

t3_2a7l9t	"CMV: the potential disappearance of polar bears, caused by global warming, would have zero effect on my life."

<p>I believe that the potential disappearance of the polar bear is exactly as bad for my life as the disparition of the dodo bird, which occurred around 1662: it has exactly zero impact.</p>

<p>I have nothing against polar bears, despite their being &quot;known to kill and sometimes eat humans&quot; (wikipedia), but I have no interaction with them. They do not produce anything that I need, and I think most humans do not rely on the polar bear for anything.</p>

<p>We should be concerned by zillions of other human problems before we even start thinking about doing anything to artificially save a population of polar bears.</p>

<p>Change my view :)</p>

t3_2hh4ou	CMV: Whether or not Leo DiCaprio or Al Gore uses private jets or yachts has absolutely nothing to do with climate change or their credibility in speaking out.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I feel like this is an incredibly common, cynical sentiment you read all over the Internet: &quot;pfft I bet DiCaprio took a private jet and a yacht to get to the speech. Typical hollywood hypocrite. Climate Change is a farce.&quot; and rarely do I see anyone stick up for the obvious truth and put that argument to bed. </p>

<p>Whether or not DiCaprio uses a jet has absolutely no bearing on whether or not Climate Change is a real problem. It has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he can speak on it. What, is he supposed to travel by hot air balloon? There is no hypocrisy, because no one is advocating the ban of private jets. No one is advocating that everyone must take a vow of poverty before they can be considered a credible advocate. The message is that POLICY needs to change. Big scale economic and global policy is needed, because the problem is trillions of times bigger than one guy and his yacht. I have never heard these guys advocate the ban of private jets. I&#39;ve never heard them advocate the ban of yachts. I&#39;ve never heard them say that every individual needs to take a vow of poverty. So, they are not hypocrites. Thus, attacking them personally for not being perfectly flawless examples of carbon-free lifestyles is clearly just attacking the messenger, setting up an unreasonable strawman, and trying to shut down the debate. It adds nothing constructive, does not have anything to do with the science itself or the validity of the message itself, it&#39;s a pure red herring.</p>

t3_pa3sub	CMV: You can't prove climate change is man-made	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I believe that you can only prove a very strong correlation.</p>

<p>A measurement is <strong>reliable if you repeat it and get the same or a similar answer over and over again</strong>, and an experiment is reliable if it gives the same result when you repeat the entire experiment.</p>

<p>As a result, I believe that there is no experiment to prove that climate change is real.</p>

<p>Sure you can look at historical data and see that temperatures are rapidly rising together with rising usage of fossil fuels but that does not necessarily imply causation. (Even though I personally believe it is.)</p>

<p>First off, I don&#39;t think it is a yes or no question, the topic of climate change and global warming exists but what should be done to prevent further change.  What should humans do to become better stewards to the planet.</p>

<p>And with that said, what other science topic are most people informed on?  Not much.  Why do they have to be informed on climate change and global warming.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A warning at the outset: if you’re prone to anxiety and depression, especially about existential risk and/or the impacts of climate change, please take care of yourself and maybe avoid this discussion entirely.</p>

<p>Throwaway because talking about this makes me feel like a crazy person. Sorry about all the links, but it sounds even more deranged without citations (and maybe I’ve misinterpreted some of them and your clarifications will persuade me).</p>

<p>I have a BS in environmental sciences (quant heavy), and a large fraction of a PhD in bioinformatics. So while not any kind of expert, I like to think I&#39;m scientifically and statistically literate, especially in the relevant fields of ecology, evolution, energy and sustainability; and generally I have experience in scientific critical thinking and data interpretation.</p>

<p>There are four major points that have convinced me we are on an irreversible path to destruction.</p>

<p><strong>1. Our models are right on track.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The IPCC reports and models have been pretty <a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/566749-todays-climate-reality-was-predicted-by-ipcc-30-years-ago-now-what"">accurate thus far</a>, and check out the first graph in <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58130705"">this BBC article</a> – observed temperatures track (or exceed) their simulations.</li>
<li><a href=""https://news.un.org/en/story/2019/11/1052171"">These models predict we&#39;ll reach a temperature increase of 3.2C</a> this century, even if we meet current emissions goals (that we’re not meeting).</li>
<li><a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/19/16908402/global-warming-2-degrees-climate-change"">At a 2C rise</a>, food production is significantly down, dangerous and extreme weather are worse, and sea levels increase by a predicted 50cm. I can’t find a neat infographic to describe the destruction at 3C, but <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/cities/ng-interactive/2017/nov/03/three-degree-world-cities-drowned-global-warming"">here’s</a> a depressing list of cities expected to be submerged. (N.B: we&#39;re currently at 1.2C above pre-industrial levels, so imagine what the fires and flooding will look like in a few years)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>2. We haven’t even been trying to model tipping points and equilibrium shifts.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Our models are only accurate thus far because we haven’t fully activated any <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/jun/03/climate-tipping-points-could-topple-like-dominoes-warn-scientists"">tipping points</a> yet (at least to a visibly exponential phase).</li>
<li>Don&#39;t forget about all those <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210225113357.htm"">recent</a> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/aug/05/climate-crisis-scientists-spot-warning-signs-of-gulf-stream-collapse"">articles</a> about the slowing of AMOC/the Gulf Stream, the collapse of which would have huge and sudden implications for weather across the globe.</li>
<li>On top of that, <a href=""https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/02/210202164535.htm"">reduction in emissions leads to immediate warming</a>, as we saw in spring 2020 due to COVID shutdowns. When we do eliminate emissions, our aerosol pollution shield won’t be around anymore, thus we’re already about 1C deeper than anyone’s acknowledging.</li>
<li>Add together that <a href=""https://insideclimatenews.org/news/16082021/climate-tipping-points/"">scientists think we’ll start activating irreversible tipping points at 1.5-2C</a>, and we’re already locked into 2.5+C within a few decades? Yikes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. The way our financial systems work is to create money through debt on the assumption of future productivity. This assumes monotonic, often exponential growth of value produced by humans.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>In the context of climate change, this is a death sentence - banks are not allowed to conceive of a world in which growth does not continue. So financial incentives cannot value degrowth. So everyone keeps depleting resources and emitting more carbon, GDP is up up up, even though everyone would be much better off if it...wasn&#39;t like that.</li>
<li>Optimists point out that plenty of our resources are clean and renewable, but I assume the transition into those systems will take decades. We don’t have decades to continue emissions at this level.</li>
<li>It gets even dicier when you add in the effects of governments and citizens hemorrhaging money and resources due to wildfires, flooding, freshwater shortages, famine, sea-level rise and refugee crises, mass unemployment and citizen revolts. As these events happen with increasing frequency across the globe and start piling up on each other, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/21/climate-change-could-make-insurance-too-expensive-for-ordinary-people-report"">the insurance industry doesn’t stand a chance</a> and the banks are not far behind.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>4. Too many humans suck really bad at confronting global catastrophe, see COVID-19.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>The situation got out of hand because of a cover-up (<a href=""https://exxonknew.org/"">ExxonMobil</a> / <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/how-chinas-authoritarian-system-made-the-pandemic-worse/2020/04/17/2a72c652-80ba-11ea-9040-68981f488eed_story.html"">Wuhan govt</a>)</li>
<li>Surprise, it got worse because of media and government denial that it was an issue worth taking seriously (<a href=""https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/03/27/pandemic_brings_out_the_best_and_the_worst_in_the_media_142791.html"">COVID downplayed in the US until it was unmanageable</a> / <a href=""https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-polisci-051215-022857"">fully one half of Americans in 2015 did not agree that temperatures are rising due to human activity</a>)</li>
<li>Even when consequences became clear, the situation continued to devolve due to the actions of a subset of idiots refusing to enforce scientifically-proven mitigation strategies (<a href=""https://www.newsobserver.com/news/local/article218287205.html"">NC banned a study on sea level rise</a> / <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/kimberleespeakman/2021/07/16/these-states-have-banned-schools-from-requiring-covid-vaccination-and-masks/?sh=2e46c32323aa"">eight states have banned vaccination and mask mandates</a>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Some of my examples above are specific to the US, but unfortunately everyone is forced to share an atmosphere with us. So I feel that the only realistic way of saving the earth in time is a combination of mass revolt (like supernationally-coordinated grassroots terrorism to sabotage corporations with the biggest non-essential GHG emissions), really dangerous geoengineering projects (e.g. aerosols in the atmosphere to reflect sunlight a la Snowpiercer), and the introduction of financial measures that are unthinkable or wildly unpopular right now (best example I’ve heard of is carbon sequestration as basis for a new currency).</p>

<p>I don’t deny that those things could save us, if we act now. I would like to point out that…we aren’t acting now, even as the visible effects of climate change continue to worsen at ever increasing rates. I argue that our inevitable failure is baked into the system. In the political sphere, geriatric obstructionists will continue to be elected for the next decade at least, and inconvenient (but absolutely necessary!) solutions will not be politically tractable until it&#39;s way too late. Similarly, in the financial sphere, people with the power to change things are locked into the current status quo that enriches them and the shareholders they’re accountable to. It’s not like these billionaires are oblivious either – they know what’s coming. <a href=""https://www.hamptonthink.org/read/how-the-rich-plan-to-rule-a-burning-planet"">Their solution is to build private bunkers. </a></p>

<p><strong>TLDR:</strong> By my estimation, most likely is the outcome where things will get worse, as we’ve been seeing for the past 5 years or so; and the rate of things getting worse will become exponential, much as our emissions have been (and remember we’re currently only seeing the effects from gasses emitted <a href=""https://earth.org/data_visualization/the-time-lag-of-climate-change/"">ten years ago</a> in 2011 (39Gt), <a href=""https://www.statista.com/statistics/276629/global-co2-emissions/"">and we’ve been emitting more ever since</a> (up to 43Gt in 2019), the effects of which won’t be seen til 2040); our fragile web of supply chains will buckle; people will be dying and willing to die to save the earth before those in power are willing to change; and so there will be massive uprisings to upset the status quo, which sounds “nice” being that it’s necessary, but will ultimately lead to instability and infighting and the consequent inability to address any problems but our own civil wars, <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nclimate2833"">as</a> <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-05252-y"">hundreds of millions</a> <a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28782036/"">die</a> in <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/heat-and-humidity-are-already-reaching-the-limits-of-human-tolerance/"">wet bulb 35 heatwaves</a>, arable temperatures move away from existing infrastructure to produce food, drought and desertification worsen, billions more die by famine while nation states <a href=""https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/150302-syria-war-climate-change-drought"">collapse under the pressure of climate refugees and civil war</a>, kinship communities pop up where they can eke out a living for a few generations. All by 2120 I’d guess, based on the literature linked throughout this post. Many journalists and scientists agree with my estimate – give <a href=""https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/07/climate-change-earth-too-hot-for-humans.html"">this 2017 Intelligencer article</a> a read if you really want to get fucked up today.</p>

<p>I&#39;d put it at 70% likelihood that &quot;first world&quot; nations will start collapsing like dominos in my lifetime (i.e. the next 50 years). Anecdotally: a small but concerning subset of my fellow scientist friends are getting Weird. Prepper levels of weird, buying land for a homestead in Wisconsin levels of weird. I am getting very close to those levels of weird myself, and I would LOVE to be talked out of it. Please CMV.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So the jury is pretty much in when it comes to human-caused climate change. Study after study. Endless scientific evidence. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re someone, let&#39;s say a libertarian for the sake of argument, who believes the government&#39;s job is to generally stay out of the way. Penn Jillette says a good place to start would be to stop killing people overseas and to stop putting stoners and hookers in jail. Maybe a lot of us would agree. But we&#39;d all agree I&#39;m sure, not just libertarians but socialists and communists too, that crimes like murder and rape and theft are acceptable crimes for the government to get involved in because the perpetrators cause direct and severe harm to other human beings.</p>

<p>Well nowhere is this more the case than with global warming. As a species we&#39;ve fucked ourselves big time. The planet itself and a lot of other species are going to be relatively ok even if things keep getting worse, but we&#39;re not. It&#39;s clear that things are not looking good for us, even with all the amazing work that is already being done. It&#39;s just not enough. Of all the things that could end our species, it appears global warming is the one that is by far the most imminent.</p>

<p>Such a large majority of the world&#39;s population, especially large in the West, still leads utterly environmentally irresponsible lifestyles - I know I can certainly be one of them! - and I really don&#39;t think personal responsibility is going to cut it. The evidence shows us that there need to be far more drastic and widespread changes. I think any government that seeks to outlaw environmentally irresponsible behavior would be no different than a government which outlaws murder, and that we&#39;d all have a moral and humanitarian obligation to support such a government. Even libertarians. Please change my view!</p>

t3_26j49i	"CMV: Focusing on the ""economic fallout"" is the new form of climate change denial."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I just watched a debate that matched the exact same argument I&#39;ve had over and over and over with libertarians and conservatives, both when I was one myself and following through to the present day:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJj0JlcFKzY"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jJj0JlcFKzY</a></p>

<p>In it, they not only undermine the credibility of the research showing the effects of climate change again and again, but when finally pinned down and forced to answer questions about its effects, default to the potential economic impact to sidestep having to actually <em>do</em> anything about the issue.</p>

<p>Even putting aside the repeated evasions, conspiracy theories, and derisiveness that they use, the crux of their argument could be boiled down to one simple question:</p>

<p>&quot;If we could take a .06% loss of growth to solve this problem. Would you do that?&quot;  And when the answer was no, &quot;Would you spend <em>any</em> money to fix this issue?&quot;</p>

<p>And the answer was no, defaulting to an ideological &quot;decentralize and let the states deal with it,&quot; ignoring once again the studies showing that dealing with the symptoms like heat waves is exponentially more expensive than dealing with the solutions, because there are <em>dozens</em> of symptoms, each which costs more with every year that passes.</p>

<p>So in the past few decades, the evolution of climate denial seems to go like this:</p>

<p>First they said climate change isn&#39;t happening.</p>

<p>Then they said climate change might be happening, but it&#39;s not manmade.</p>

<p>Then they said climate change is probably happening and might be manmade, but it&#39;s not going to make any difference.</p>

<p>Then they said climate change is happening and is probably manmade, but it doesn&#39;t matter because any potential negatives would be offset by the good. Everyone loves <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sGKvDNdJNA"">carbon dioxide!</a>(Yes, that&#39;s a real advertisement).</p>

<p>Now they say, yes it&#39;s real, yes it&#39;s man made, and yes the effects are negative... but the models are still wrong, the problems are being exaggerated, and most importantly, <strong>there&#39;s still nothing we should do about it</strong>, except maybe put up some water dams and ration our water better in the summer.  </p>

<p>To me, this is still denial: denial of the data, denial of the studies.  The whole point of raising awareness of climate change, and the whole point of denying it, has always been about whether we should <em>do something about its effects.</em>  Accepting the premise but brushing off the conclusions is still denial, and accusing the scientists of conspiracy is even further signs of science denial.</p>

<p>An economist saying &quot;I disagree with the models&quot; does not hold any legitimacy when you are not a climate scientist. The place for them to debate is in the solutions: not in the premise itself, which other climate scientists who are qualified to understand it should address.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve debated with people dozens of times about the inefficiency and pointlessness of addressing the symptoms of climate change rather than the causes, and at the end of the day, every time, it comes back to a denial of the data, or cherry picking of study abstracts.  &quot;15% increased crop yields in central America!&quot;  That&#39;s fantastic, now keep reading about how that pales in comparison to the effects of a second Dust Bowl forming in the States.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s be clear:</p>

<p><strong>Apocalyptic Climate Change is a strawman.</strong> No climate scientists say, and as far as I can recall have ever said, that climate change will &quot;end our species&quot; or turn the planet into a barren wasteland.  I don&#39;t care what politicians say: science denial is about denying the science, and people who bring up scaremongering of people that want to set everyone back to the stone age are being doubly insincere. If they really cared about the solution, they would be offering alternatives: not denying the premise.</p>

<p>And the premise has always been consistent. The science shows that it&#39;s our current way of life that&#39;s going to suffer. Food availability, fresh water sources, ease of transportation, tourism, health, biodiversity, increased storm severity, stronger heat waves... these are not just isolated, &quot;feel good&quot; issues, like saving a polar bear on an ice float. These are all huge concerns that are already having massive <strong>economic</strong> impacts.</p>

<p>And yet conservatives insist that they&#39;re &quot;worried about economics&quot; when they minimize these impacts and insist that it can all be dealt with at a local level.</p>

<p>I live in Miami, and I&#39;ve actually had someone tell me that we can just &quot;put a wall up&quot; to block rising tides. A &quot;no nonsense, just the numbers&quot; libertarian told me that... and then walked away when I entertained the premise of his argument and asked what impact this wall would have on Miami&#39;s tourism and coastal land values.</p>

<p>This is denialism, to me. This is a refusal to accept that maybe, just maybe, there are some things that the government, specifically federal government, has to have a hand in ameliorating.</p>

<p>And if it means denying the science, accusing the scientists of chasing money (never mind how much money any of these scientists could make selling out to fossil fuel companies), and insisting that they&#39;re &quot;just trying to be pragmatic,&quot; there&#39;s no practical difference between &quot;Climate change isn&#39;t happening&quot; and &quot;Climate change is happening and is manmade, but we don&#39;t have to spend any money to fix it.&quot;</p>

<p>Change my view, please and thanks.</p>

<p>TL;DR: There is none. Read the whole thing. If you bring up a point I addressed in the post, I&#39;m just going to ignore you.</p>

t3_5hi9k1	CMV: Denying the existence of implicit bias is comparable to being a creationist or climate change denier.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First off, here&#39;s how <a href=""http://scholarship.law.berkeley.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1250&amp;context=californialawreview"">Anthony Greenwald</a> defines &quot;implicit bias&quot;:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Theories of implicit bias contrast with the &quot;naive&quot; psychological conception of social behavior, which views human actors as being guided solely by their explicit beliefs and their conscious intentions to act. […] In contrast, the science of implicit cognition suggests that actors do not always have conscious, intentional control over the processes of social perception, impression formation, and judgment that motivate their actions. [...] Implicit biases are discriminatory biases based on implicit attitudes or implicit stereotypes. Implicit biases are especially intriguing, and also especially problematic, because they can produce behavior that diverges from a person&#39;s avowed or endorsed beliefs or principles.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is today a robust, uncontroversial scientific consensus that implicit bias is a real and universal feature of human psychology. For some perspective, check out <a href=""http://kirwaninstitute.osu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/2015-kirwan-implicit-bias.pdf"">this 2015 report from the Kirwan Institute</a>. </p>

<p>I&#39;m not going to bother counting the works cited, but you can see them for yourself on pages 67-83.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Everybody knows that the social and behavioral sciences are lousy with leftist social justice warriors. They can&#39;t be trusted!</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href=""http://www.pewforum.org/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/"">Scientists in general are about ten times as likely as non-scientists are to be non-religious.</a> Does that count as a point in favor of creationism?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s an alternative explanation: perhaps there are actual facts about the world, and the process of becoming an expert on a given class of facts tends to promote views consistent with them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But what about <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis"">the replication crisis?</a> It proves that all of psychology is nothing more than a bunch of feminist propaganda!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There&#39;s no doubt that the so-called &quot;replication crisis&quot; is a real problem for experimental psychology in general, but the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piltdown_Man"">familiar</a> impulse to misinterpret any and every failure associated with a particular scientific community as a blanket indictment of everything they&#39;ve ever produced is ugly, dishonest, and naive.</p>

<p><a href=""http://heterodoxacademy.org/2016/02/23/are-most-published-social-psychology-findings-false/"">Here&#39;s a good, evenhanded discussion</a> of the study that launched a thousand misguided think pieces. Note that it&#39;s posted on a blog whose stated mission is &quot;to create a credible counterforce to entrenched orthodoxies,&quot; with particular attention to the fact that &quot;between 1995 and 2010 the academy went from leaning left to being almost entirely on the left.&quot;</p>

<p><a href=""https://osf.io/ezum7/"">Here&#39;s the study itself.</a> The lead author is Brian Nosek, who is incidentally a co-founder of <a href=""https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html"">Project Implicit</a>--&quot;a non-profit organization and international collaboration between researchers who are interested in implicit social cognition.&quot;</p>

<p>Here&#39;s what Nosek had to say about implicit bias in <a href=""https://osf.io/p847h/"">another of his recent publications:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Accumulated evidence leaves <strong>no doubt</strong> that implicit measures predict behavior.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There you have it: today&#39;s highest-profile champion of scientific rigor is fully convinced. So am I wrong to believe that denying the existence of implicit bias is kinda like being an anti-vaxxer, or refusing to immunize your children? CMV!</p>

t3_d1tbsk	CMV: Believing climate change is real doesn't mean any proposed policies are worth voting for	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The part I can agree with is that climate change is ocurring and it would be embarassing to see this coming and not do anything.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the scope of research being conducted. Many scientific studies use data only as far back as the 1800s, without any respect for data reflecting the climate in Roman times, or how we entered and exited several ice ages, etc etc. I don&#39;t agree with highlighting only the bad, where a species or ecosystem fails to adapt, without highlighting any ecosystem creation. If we really are losing so much ice, more of the land ice once covered should be arable.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t agree with the Green New Deal, banning straws, buying smartcars, forgoing nuclear power, reducing purchase of oil, or just about any other proposed measure. First and foremost, nuclear power is amongst the cleanest and safest forms of energy, even when you account for catastrophic events. Even if it weren&#39;t, isn&#39;t it better to use nuclear material for energy than war? Second, the economic measures I&#39;ve heard so far don&#39;t stand much of a chance on a global scale. If developed countries buy less oil - law of supply and demand - undeveloped countries will be able to afford more oil, for a global zero sum game.</p>

<p>Where&#39;s the love for innovation? If an area will receive more hurricanes, perhaps we stop building from wood, and start favoring brick? If an area will flood easier, why not make all the buildings float for such an occasion? If an area will get hotter, why not open a tropical themed restaurant? If we&#39;re going to have an abundance of plastic, why not focus on the worms or bacteria that like to eat it?</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>COP21 is upon us and with it comes much consternation about how we as a species will tackle climate change. To be clear, I believe in climate change and that it is largely caused by human activity. However, I also believe that with globalization and the &quot;rise of the rest&quot; that it is unrealistic to believe we will cut global consumption to a level that reduces or reverses climate change.</p>

<p>I won&#39;t go into the arguments of developed vs developing countries right to pollute although I believe that this plays a role as well.</p>

<p>With so many factors working against meaningful action to stop climate change, I believe our best bet is to address our growing energy concerns and develop infrastructure that will allow us to adapt to a changing environment (seawalls and the like).</p>

<p>I really want someone to CMV.</p>

<p>EDIT: so my view hasn&#39;t been totally changed but it&#39;s certainly been altered to have a more balanced approach. </p>

<p>One thing I learned from this thread is that the reasonable arguments for how we realistically deal with climate change tend to get drowned out by people screaming the sky is falling and we are all going to die. That&#39;s not true and by claiming it is you make everyone ignore you and the real problem and nothing gets done. Let&#39;s be better than the climate deniers folks. </p>

t3_68tm40	CMV: Jailing climate change skeptics violates the right to free speech.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>From what I can tell, Bill Nye is open to jailing climate change deniers for voicing opposition to global warming. My reasons for thinking that this is Nye&#39;s view are that I found a video of Nye in which he sounded clearly open to the possibility and the news articles I can find on the subject are all consistent with that conclusion. Also, it is not that uncommon for people who regard a particular political view as very harmful to be in favor of the state punishing its advocates.</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlk4Lt__Sn0"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xlk4Lt__Sn0</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/15/bill-nye-science-guy-open-to-jail-time-f"">http://reason.com/blog/2016/04/15/bill-nye-science-guy-open-to-jail-time-f</a></p>

<p>I think anyone who has a cursory acquaintance with the concept can see that jailing climate change deniers would be a violation of the right to free speech. The right to free speech means being able to voice the political conclusions you arrive at without being punished by the state, even if those views are harmful or vile. Even the worst white supremacist should be allowed to speak his mind without being punished by the state - although that does not mean other people are obligated to give them a platform, or that they will be immune from the condemnation and contempt of others for their views.</p>

<p>The right to free speech must be respected by any free society because it follows from the right to think. If people are free to think for themselves and arrive at their own conclusions, then they must be free to express those conclusions without fear of punishment by the state, because arriving at a conclusion will necessarily lead to expressing it in some way. Punishing people for advocating the conclusions they have arrived at is equivalent to &quot;thought crime,&quot; which is a feature of the worst Medieval or Communist dictatorships.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll award a delta if someone can show that Bill Nye is not saying he is open to this, or that this would not violate the right to free speech, or that we shouldn&#39;t have the right to free speech.</p>

<p>It would be wiser for me to start investing and building a new future in Places like Canada or Northern America because as the world gets &quot;warmer&quot;, some places will essentially get a net benefit while others suffer things like worse weather.</p>

<p>In the Case of Canada I believe the warmer world would mean more of its northern sectors will melt and become more habitable while cities that are &quot;cold&quot; like Toronto will simply get comfortably warmer.</p>

<p>The other reason is that the Northern US and Canada also are right next door to the worlds largest Supply of Fresh Water which is become all the more scarce especially in a climate changed world.</p>

<p>So please help change my view and I dont really wanna go through the trouble of moving but somehow in the back of my mind I think I should start working on finding a place where a Warming Planet will have a Positive effect rather than a negative in most of the world.</p>

t3_pgfx6b	cmv: Oil is Abiotic and is not a fossil fuel	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>ESL: I remember first hearing about the abiotic oil theory as a joke but honestly it ends up making more sense the more I investigated it, basically the abiotic oil theory states that the oil we extract from the Earth did not have living precursor, be that algae, plankton or Dinosaurs but instead is created beneath the Earth Crust, similarly to how Lava erupts due to the created immense pressure and decay of nuclear elements in the centre of the earth, and the convection of Magma leading to the surface. Is it not too feasible that liquid hydrocarbons can also be created and transported in the similar way?</p>

<p>I have a few points that can raise some questions or make you think, if you can refute this go ahead</p>

<ul>
<li>According to google, we globally consume  <strong>97,103,871 barrels per day</strong> of oil, now to put that in perspective, the weight of a single barrel of oil is approximately 135kg, thats over <strong>Ten million tons</strong> a day, and that trend has kept approximately the same for the past decade or so, so we can assume that an unfathomable mass of oil has been extracted from the earth since Humanity has been alive, but according to the biogenic oil theory we&#39;re told to believe that oil comes from dead &amp;decaying plankton, algae, vegetation and dinosaurs over the past  <strong>3.7 billion years</strong> which to me doesn&#39;t really add up, how many billions of ton of life would have to die and not be reincorporated into the natural cycle, then sink and decay in order for this to occur and supply what oil we could extract, It makes more sense that hydrocarbons from the stars that ended up inside the earth and merely leaks back to the top, just like Magma</li>
<li>Please remember that the &quot;organic&quot; when referring to molecule means that it has a Carbon-Hydrogen bond, not that it came from life. The composition of crude hydrocarbons taken from the earth itself contain many toxic elements and compounds, such as vanadium and mercury, can anybody find any sort of biomarkers or indication of life from anything in oil, any trace at all? I mean any DNA or plant matter would&#39;ve degraded so its rather a moot point</li>
<li>Depth oil can be found VS Depth fossils have been discovered, now I understand we may not be able to find any fossils in certain areas due to technical limitations, but considering how the layers of the Earth are we can estimate how deep something will sink over time, the deepest fossil we&#39;ve discovered was found at 2256 metres while the deepest oil well we&#39;ve pumped up was 10,683 metres, thats over 4x as deep, now there are lifeforms at the bottom of the sea but they themselves are supported by (guess what) hydrocarbons and sulphur vents coming from cracks in the Ocean, tell me where all that methane comes from? So far the deepest life we&#39;ve discovered is &quot;One microorganism called Desulforudis audaxviator was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth’s surface&quot; so even if we had a colony of extremophiles underneath the earth that still wouldn&#39;t be enough to be responsible for all that earth, we can assume that some point, perhaps 5km under the earth life will be completely sterile and nothing living will exist</li>
<li>Presence of extraterrestrial oil, just check the NASA website or the many articles, there&#39;s plenty of oil that&#39;s been discovered on place like Mars or Saturn, infact Titan has more crude oil on its surface the Earth does entirely(I think) also the presence of oil on Asteroids and Comets has been confirmed, are we really saying that Earth is the only planet has its oil come from biogenic sources like algae and microorganism while everything else in the solar system has its abiotic oil  hydrocarbons from other sources like stars?</li>
<li>Location oil wells are found in, we can find oil wells in non-porous rock, meaning that no oil could seep in from above , remember that fossils are usually only found in sedimentary rocks, yet oil deposits can be found in oil can be found in metamorphic and igneous rocks(we can&#39;t find fossils in igneous rocks, they get melted to magma) so where did all that oil come from? if not biological matter then what? We also observe some oil reserves, previously depleted to be replenishing itself, if true that this oil came from natural life then this would take millions and millions of dead creatures and millions of years to decay to seep into the oil wells, opposed to oil from deep within the earth seeping back up</li>
<li>I understand other fuel sources are genuine fossil fuels like peatbog and coal, derived from living matter but there are much larger deposits of oil then all the other sources found</li>
<li>The processes of the earth which constantly pushes Magma to the surface and creates volcanoes, the immense heat and pressure, the decay of nuclear elements at the planets core and the raw materials within the earth from broken stars can all produce a multitude of chemical reactions we still don&#39;t understand, and we know that these processes can form and push magma up to the surface of the earth creating lava and volcanoes, is it that much of a jump to think the crude oil, hydrocarbons can also be produced from carbon and hydrogen in the earth crust can be pushed into oil wells and other deposits?</li>
</ul>

<p>Anyways please let me know you think about it, and Im interested in how my points will be refuted</p>

t3_puk9rq	CMV: The left has hijacked environmentalism	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I’m anticipating some of hate for this, but I hope that any opponents from both sides are at least open minded in their critiques.</p>

<p>Let me start off by saying that I don’t deny the right’s faults concerning environmentalism by focusing on the left in this post, but I believe that is its own, already widely discussed topic.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Environmentalism used to be widely supported by both the right and the left, with Nixon being ranked the 2nd most green US president in history. Resistance to environmentalism both existed on the right and the left, many socialist parties countering environmentalism saying it was an “upper-class fad”.</p>

<p>I believe there is good evidence that some leftist groups, notably Clinton’s Vice President Al Gore, have strongly contributed to today’s divide by 1) merging, cross-selling environmentalism with other leftist agendas such as wealth distribution &amp; increased taxes, and 2) demonizing or opposing any environmentalist solutions from the right as not being “real” environmentalism. I&#39;m not saying those other leftist agendas are good or bad, but you can&#39;t deny that the right not supporting those green-left proposals, do so solely because they don&#39;t like environmental measures.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Much more pronounced today, as a European centrist, when talking with American leftists I’m faced with knee-jerk reactions, that because as a non-leftist I espouse environmental ideals, I must automatically be a lying conservative pushing a far-right agenda.</p>

<p>This doesn’t do justice to <a href=""https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/04/21/how-americans-see-climate-change-and-the-environment-in-7-charts/"">the 39% of Republicans who believe the environment should be a top priority &amp; the 45% of young republicans who have a positive view of more strict environmental regulations</a>. The right has much room for improvement, but so certainly does the left does when it comes to polarization.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Edit 1: I see many people pitting leftism VS rightism as if there is a single cause. The term highjacking &quot;</strong> <strong><em>take over (something) and use it for a different purpose</em></strong> <strong>&quot; is legitimate to describe a phenomenon, without saying it is the only, or even main cause.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Also I see many people claiming that the right dropped environmentalism BEFORE the above mentioned measures on the left, which is counter to the widely supported historical record. Of course, you are free to share conclusive evidence of the opposite.</strong></p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p><strong>Edit 2: I see many progressive leftists completely denying the premise, but then insisting that rightism, capitalism, or republicanism contradicts environmentalism by their nature, insisting that prior environmentalist efforts from the right had 0 legitimacy. Do you not see the point? Do you not at least read each others comments?</strong></p>

t3_27kvij	CMV: Anthropogenic Global Warming is Not Happening	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I was challenged by someone to post here, so I am. I don&#39;t believe in anthropogenic global warming. Please don&#39;t use silly insults like &quot;climate [change] denier&quot; or anything similar when responding. Let&#39;s be adults. Rule #1 in convincing someone of your position should be to <em>never</em> insult them. Just scientifically prove that they are wrong. Also, please refrain from appeals to authority. If you say &quot;other people say so&quot; or give me the... let&#39;s just say flawed &quot;consensus&quot; argument, that&#39;s not an argument. I want to be proven that AGW is real, if it is, as I assume it is not. I used to be on the fence, leaning toward believing in it, through the 90&#39;s into the 2000s, because that&#39;s what smart people and the media said so I assumed it to be true. But in the last ten years I&#39;ve done plenty of research on the matter and it seems like the silliest thing I&#39;ve ever heard. And I keep getting new, totally absurd predictions about what&#39;s definitely going to happen if we don&#39;t take action NOW on &quot;anthropogenic changing of the globally warming climate,&quot; or whatever you&#39;re calling it nowadays, then we&#39;ll all die or something. All of these predictions are insane and are proven such when their time comes to pass. All claims I&#39;ve ever seen that &quot;more or less of X is caused by man!&quot; are easily debunked with even a tiny bit of research. The corruption and duplicity in the pro-AGW camp is replete and nauseating. The theory of AGW is also the most arrogant thing I&#39;ve ever heard. Sure, we <em>pollute</em> the planet - a lot, and I reduce, reuse, recycle far more than just about anyone I know and want an electric car, etc. - but we don&#39;t CHANGE THE CLIMATE. Period. Have at it. Tell me why I&#39;m wrong. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>EDIT: trying to adhere to all the rules, etc. I think I&#39;m low on substance of my current view because the burden of proof lies in the people that want to destroy the economies of the world for something that I&#39;m not convinced is even real. But I&#39;ll try to expand. I&#39;m supposed to explain why I believe what I do, so I&#39;ll add a little more. I&#39;ve seen predictions for many years that have fallen flat on their faces. These same people (sometimes) have believed in every major catastrophe and pushed it as the most important thing ever. Their solutions always seem to center around controlling economies. The Earth is far more powerful than us and can easily handle everything we do. I totally agree with George Carlin when he says this: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c&amp;feature=kp"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7W33HRc1A6c&amp;feature=kp</a> - this is the most arrogant one, too. The idea that we can control nature? Wow. The idea that we can <em>counteract</em> the Sun? I don&#39;t even know where to begin.</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I really appreciate the links and will look at ALL of them in due time. But that&#39;s time consuming so bear with me. I&#39;m just trying to respond as much as I can quickly and succinctly while being a busy dad, husband and career man</p>

t3_9mro8r	CMV: Climate change should be the the focus in upcoming elections.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>As we move into a new round of important elections, at least in the US, politicians should put their plans for combating climate change front and center, and deeply criticizes those who deny it. As nations and individuals we really need to act quickly in order to limit the damage. I know saying &quot;should&quot; can be the wrong word to use but I believe it would would show the candidate to be corrupt or ignorant if they don&#39;t address the issue. </p>

<p>There are many issues that face us as a society, but climate change is the one most likely to threaten our core way of life if nothing is done. I don&#39;t think there is any other issue that should trump that of climate change in terms of immediate importance. It is on the same level as the threat of global nuclear war, which rightfully received this kind of attention during the cold war when it was especially likely.   </p>

t3_1rcrz0	"I believe that man made global warming to be made up, CMV"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p><strong>[EDIT]</strong></p>

<p><strong>Consider this case closed. You&#39;ve changed my mind. More below. Many thanks</strong></p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not the first to ask this here, but I suppose this is a special case.</p>

<p>So this is probably going to be easy for you guys, as I&#39;m currently in limbo.</p>

<p>Sometime during my teenage years, I got a bit too deep into conspiracy theories. I dropped almost every aspect of that, but for that stuff concerning global warming.</p>

<p>As I was rather passionate about it, I found it hard to drop it as a belief. Confronted with more and more clever people (i.e people who&#39;s world view I respected - Lawrence Krauss being the most prominent one) saying that it was an actual problem, I chickened out and then decided to be undecided. That needs to be changed. ASAP.</p>

<p>My main problems with that idea were the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>I found that people who spoke out for man made warming, for the most part, to be biased hippies, who&#39;d abolish anything that doesn&#39;t run on love. (obvious exaggeration, but that&#39;s how I felt)</li>
<li>The media would, as it often does, engage in very selective reporting. To this day I sometimes want to throw up at what I read (or don&#39;t read). But that&#39;s a different story.</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of the two triggered a general Fuck You attitude and I took the position that the hippies were misinformed by the media, where they got all their sources anyway, and thus had to be wrong.</p>

<p>Add to that some &#39;facts&#39; and that&#39;s how I became a climate sceptic. These were:</p>

<ul>
<li>NASA changed the rounding process of the temperatures, skewing the outcome.</li>
<li>The famous &#39;hockey stick&#39; prediction was based upon a formula that always had the same outcome, no matter what you fed it.</li>
<li>Temperature readings didn&#39;t include that fact that towns tend to be warmer than the countryside, thus making all the sensors set up in built up areas useless. Meteorological balloons, however, didn&#39;t indicate any warming.</li>
<li>We can&#39;t even say what the weather will be next week, let alone what it&#39;ll do in 10 years.</li>
<li>The predictions published we&#39;re all the most extreme possibilities, and just another way of the media to gain views.</li>
<li>The IPCC isn&#39;t as much a scientific panel as it is a political one.</li>
<li>Al Gore&#39;s film was full of confirmation bias (god, I was a hypocritical little fucker, wasn&#39;t I?) and he didn&#39;t practice what he preached by driving around in SUV&#39;s, letting the engines run, having a series of huge mansions, etc.</li>
<li>As the pole caps are still there: we&#39;re technically still in an ice age and it is natural for the pole caps to melt, so stop whining.</li>
<li>There&#39;s has been way hotter periods with more carbon.</li>
<li>There&#39;s so much more carbon occurring naturally, our impact is to be considered almost zero.</li>
<li>The Taiga forest alone could cope with 5 times the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.</li>
<li>More carbon means more food for plants to feast upon.</li>
<li>Most importantly: the warming of the atmosphere has to do with the sun&#39;s influence and the CO2 rises with about 500 years of delay.</li>
</ul>

<p>So please Reddit, change my view.</p>

<p>(On mobile, so excuse formatting and typos)</p>

<p><strong>[Edit]</strong>
<strong>As I&#39;ve mentioned many times below, I&#39;ll go through everything presented to me and come back tomorrow, possibly rewarding deltas.</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Edit 2]</strong>
So yeah, you did it Reddit. I wanted to wait till tomorrow, but my previous state of in limbo was completely obliterated, so I thought I&#39;d do it now.</p>

<p>Anyways, now as my view has been changed, having my bubble burst and being able to look back at said bubble, I have to admit that it was extremely hypocritical of me. I was no better than the creationists I find so ridiculous. Quite interestingly, I don&#39;t have a clue why I ever held that belief.</p>

<p><strong>[Edit 3]</strong>
I wanted to elaborate on my Ad Hominem:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>biased hippies, who&#39;d abolish anything that doesn&#39;t run on love</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Exaggerated? Yes. What I tried to say was that I found the scientists&#39; work to be leached upon and the most dramatic elements shouted about for personal profit.</p>

<p>It is now that I realised that the same principle applies to corporations who see themselves threatened by the green movement. How on earth didn&#39;t I see that?</p>

t3_4f9d47	"CMV: The biggest mistake of environmentalists is telling people to ""save the environment"". Environmentalism is about saving ourselves."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Environmentalists (politically) made a huge miscalculation by framing their goal as humans vs. environment. As if there is a will, and a &quot;comfortable&quot; spot for the environment, and humans are disturbing it the way you might disturb your sleeping parent.</p>

<p>But this just isn&#39;t the reality. Environmental <em>change</em> of any kind is indisputably bad for many different species, but <em>the environment</em> is <em>everything</em>. Humans are <em>incapable</em> of destroying life on earth. We couldn&#39;t do it even if we tried with our nukes in a concerted effort... life itself is so much more monolithic than our society or species, and we don&#39;t really understand that point of view well because we don&#39;t have any predators, giving us the illusion that we <em>control</em> life.</p>

<p>But, back to the main point I&#39;m making: this misunderstanding/paradigm that environmentalists subscribed to and pushed has framed environmentalism as altruism. For some people this attracts them to it, and makes them feel good about doing things like recycling. For other though it gives them the impression, because of the framing, that environmentalism is about doing things which are painful/expensive/difficult because they are &quot;right&quot;.</p>

<p>That&#39;s a load of shit.</p>

<p>Environmentalism has exactly one goal: to prevent global changes to the Earth&#39;s environment that would destabilize our ability to run a functioning society. That&#39;s it.</p>

<p>The reason we worry about species going extinct is because 1) we don&#39;t understand much about how the species interacts with the systems we depend on and 2) some species we have direct use for. Really #1 is just &quot;this species <em>might</em> be part of #2&quot;. Look at mosquitos. We have no use for them, and though it might be less than ideal from their perspective, the species that depend on mosquitos it would seem can find alternate sources. So we have seriously discussed <em>purposely</em> eradicating the species.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything inherently wrong with this, but whether it&#39;s right or wrong, it is not altruism. Environmentalism is and always has been about keeping the <em>entire world</em> in a state that we are comfortable with. To make things easy for us. Every single thing we want to do environmentally is, at its root, about reducing the pain/expense/difficulty that we cannot control.</p>

<p>By framing environmentalism as &quot;saving&quot; the environment, most people have the WRONG impression that we are somehow a threat to life itself, and it&#39;s through an act of altruistic restraint that we can redeem ourselves. But it&#39;s really that we are a threat to ourselves, and everything else is collateral damage.</p>

t3_2e3w6a	"CMV: I believe that global warming is definitely happening, but is not something major and human influence on it is minimal."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First of all, I do believe it is easy to see that global warming is happening. The earth has been warming up for at least the last century. This coincides with the industrialization of society and the resulting increase in carbon-dioxide concentration in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>These two things I know, and most people, including the IPCC, say that the later is the cause of the first. I do not share this thought, and am of the opinion that the first is an independent natural event. I like to look at the (in my eyes stable) climate with respect to the time period since the Younger Dryas, and the temperature variations of the past centuries don&#39;t appear to be exceptional when compared to this. (Source: <a href=""http://goo.gl/K0rFMd"">http://goo.gl/K0rFMd</a> (I can&#39;t find any worldwide average temperature graph on this timescale. Although the medieval warm period, and little ice age do show up in worldwide temperature graphs of the past millennium.))</p>

<p>I don&#39;t understand the climate well enough to disprove that an increase in CO2 levels causes an increase in global temperature, not by a long shot. But I would like to see a report that does the opposite. Considering the impact of certain natural events like the draining of lake Agassiz, or the eruption of volcanic eruptions with VEI &gt; 7, I can&#39;t see how humans can influence the climate on a meaningful scale.</p>

<p>Now that the hype is gone and media has left the subject alone, I think an unbiased conversation on it is finally possible. The pictures of sad seal-cubs on melting icecaps and unlabeled hockey-stick graphs really hampered the discussion for years.</p>

<p>So reddit, show me why global warming is something big, and why we are the cause of it. </p>

<p>edit:</p>

<p>I changed my view thanks to one link from <a href=""/u/NuclearStudent"">/u/NuclearStudent</a>, I am now of the opinion that human activity has raised global temperatures by about 0.6K. I am still sceptical about the size of global warming, since its within natural fluctuations, but I am no longer of the opinion that humans have minimal influence.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Growing up I was brought up extremely conservative, and for this reason always try to challenge any conservative bias I may have.  I turned out pretty Libertarian, but my biggest contention with other Libertarians is environmental issues.  Give me a couple hours and I will come up with a thousand different reasons why we must protect our environment (even if it means occasional government intervention), but climate change is not one of them.  I&#39;ve taking a couple environmental study classes at a university recognized for excellence in science, but they just furthered my belief.  A big part of this was seeing how much less bias most actual research papers have, compared to the articles that circulate on social media and elsewhere.  Here are my biggest issues with believing climate change is definitely man-made:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Earth&#39;s climate changes radically, it always has.  TV and Internet (not to mention ways to measure and observe changes) are new in the grand scheme of things, and this means we are some of the first people to witness these changes through this media, making us more aware of it than our ancestors.</p></li>
<li><p>Climate change is far too easily and often used as a political tool.</p></li>
<li><p>I don&#39;t have any examples off hand, but most of the research papers I looked into only showed correlation, but no causation.  The best example is CO2 levels.  Pop science articles take for granted that CO2 levels are raising with the CO2 we create, but many studies suggest that the Earth&#39;s CO2 levels are far greater than what humans produce.  In this case it would make more sense that CO2 levels go up as the Earth&#39;s temperature goes up.</p></li>
<li><p>People feel peer pressured into believing climate change is man made.  People who don&#39;t believe climate change is caused by man are often put in a category with 9/11 truthers and holocaust deniers.  Why would anyone want to challenge the popular belief if it gave them that label? </p></li>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>CMV: Main claim to dispute: In US politics, instead of emphasizing global warming, activists and politicians should emphasize the harm of air pollution, water pollution, over fishing, over logging, ecosystem collapse and unsustainable practices because these issues are less susceptible to partisan politics and thus more defensible and doable as real policy matters. </p>

<p>U.S. politicians&#39; and activist groups&#39; support for global warming awareness/reduction/counter-activity has hurt the cause in 2 ways. 1) global warming has been politicized and attacked by conservatives because it is a large target (undoable, too much invasive big government, reduction in individual freedoms) and 2) specific efforts to battle air pollution (CO2 emissions), water pollution, unsustainable resource use (logging, fishing, and fossil fuels) now fall under combating global warming thus fall under politicized, intransigent, partisan territory.</p>

<p>I started listening to an audiobook called &quot;Green Hell&quot; by Steven Milloy, Fox news contributor (and possible secret identity of some Captain Planet villain). In the book the author questions efforts made by Green/environmentally conscious groups and individuals. While I am not convinced about the subject matter in the book; it serves to expose that Green/environmental groups are designated as &quot;the enemy&quot;. The book serves as an example of how global warming and green causes have been politically twisted. </p>

<p>In U.S. politics, I believe that refocusing on already less disputable, smaller causes like cutting pollution and curbing consumption would be more successful than a large target like global warming. I think that this will shift the conversation towards costs of continuing or cutting pollution and consumption as opposed to partisan political wrangling and politically partisan scientists defending industry funded studies.   </p>

<p>To break the argument down to a basic level, an everyday person should agree that fishing too many fish out of a river will reduce the amount of fish available for producing more fish and future consumption. So measures can be taken to let the fish population rise to some acceptable level or continue to fish and risk losing the resource. The costs and benefits of both decisions will be weighted and one option will be undertaken. If the process is politicized then the decision process will be made along partisan lines so the costs and benefits will be distorted.</p>

<p>Edit 1: made U.S.A specific thanks to comment.</p>

<p>Edit 2: while there&#39;s some discussion, I should clarify. I support changing tactics, CMV.</p>

t3_2l6s0m	CMV: I'm not very concerned about the consequences of global warming	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I recognize that global warming is real and happening.  And I recognize that human activity appears to be the main driver of it.  But I don&#39;t think the consequences will be as dire as are portrayed for humanity.  In the following, most of my source material is going to come from the IPCC, which is I think a fairly good source for data on this, and if anything has an institutional bias in the direction of warning of dire consequences.</p>

<p>There are <del>four</del>three avenues that I think are of primary concern:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Sea level rise.  <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/unfccc/cop19/3_gregory13sbsta.pdf"">The IPCC estimates</a> a sea level rise in the range of 0.5m over the next century.  While that&#39;s not trivial, it&#39;s also not dire.  Most coastal communities can manage that level of rise with levees and sea walls.  Occasionally someone shows a map with a city like New York or Miami under a 3 or 4 meter rise in sea levels, but the IPCC estimates give that a very low probability of happening.</p></li>
<li><p>Drought and other negative impacts on agricultural production.  I do not deny that some areas will see reduced rainfall, but I don&#39;t think that can be true for everywhere (indeed, it would seem like higher aggregate temperatures would result in more atmospheric water vapor and more aggregate rainfall).  So while some areas may be negatively impacted, others will be positively impacted.  Further, we&#39;ve been getting progressively more efficient agriculturally as time goes on.  Across the world, the amount of agricultural land per capita has been falling for decades, and in developed nations, where population growth is slow, is falling in absolute terms.  See pg. 502 in <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg3/ar4-wg3-chapter8.pdf"">this IPCC report</a>  This <a href=""https://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/publications/SAR/SAR_Chapter%2013.pdf"">other report</a> on the impact of climate change on crop output says, with what&#39;s described as medium confidence that:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Global agricultural production can be maintained relative to base production under climate change as expressed by general circulation models under doubled CO2 equilibrium climate scenarios.</p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Severe weather events.  While I don&#39;t deny that global warming can cause more severe weather events such as hurricanes, I question whether this is a very dire consequence.  As our weather forecasting improves, and our disaster preparedness improves, the loss of life from weather events falls.  Even a very bad storm like Katrina was not nearly as devastating to human life as a storm <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1900_Galveston_hurricane"">with no warning</a> 100 years before.  Further, the IPCC <a href=""http://www.ipcc-wg2.gov/SREX/images/uploads/SREX-SPMbrochure_FINAL.pdf"">expresses low confidence</a> (page 6 of that source) that the number of tropical cyclones is measurably impacted by climate change.  It&#39;s a plausible hypothesis, but not one that seems to have been proven yet.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the reason I am looking to see my view possibly changed on this is that I often see people proposing dire consequences and accordingly drastic action, of the type that will massively impact standards of living, especially among people in developing nations, where energy is an enormous part of people&#39;s daily budgets.  I don&#39;t see the consequences of warming as being severe enough to justify those drastic measures, and would like to know if there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing.  Also, I&#39;m primarily concerned with the impact on humans.  While certainly we have to live in the natural environment, and so it matters that the environment is in decent shape, I see it as more an instrumentality to human wellbeing, not an end in itself.</p>

<p>For a bit of background, I&#39;m not a climate scientist and don&#39;t have any particular area of expertise in this, though I do have a fairly high base level of scientific knowledge and am open to fairly technical rebuttals.</p>

<p>Edits: fixed a link up and forgot I&#39;d consolidated my list.</p>

t3_1uuuef	"I believe that if you are not an expert in a field, you should form your beliefs based on the consensus and common beliefs of experts in that field. This applies to global warming, GMOs, and even social ideas like institutional oppression, patriarchy and privilege. CMV."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This seems like a pretty agreeable belief, but I will be applying it to a few things. </p>

<p>Since experts dedicate years of their lives to understanding and researching topics within a field, it&#39;s a type of hubris to think that we can form oppositionary viewpoints that contradict scientific consensus.</p>

<p>People who deny human&#39;s role in climate change are contradicting the <a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus"">overwhelming scientific consensus</a> that agree that climate trends can be attributed to anthropogenic activities. </p>

<p>People who believe vaccines cause autism, cancer, etc, are foolishly contradicting the science and the major medical organizations that agree that there is no such link.</p>

<p>People who believe genetically modified foods are unhealthy or dangerous are similarly going against the broad scientific consensus regarding the safety of current GMOs.</p>

<p>My final point, which I suspect will be most controversial, simply applies the previous logic that I have used, but in the context of sociological fields.</p>

<p>The majority of sociologists agree that &#39;white privilege&#39; exists (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege#cite_note-20"">1</a>). Furthermore, ideas of patriarchy and systematic oppression are the theoretical bread and butter of sociological thinking. </p>

<p>The fact that there is no scholarly support for movements and ideas purported by the men&#39;s rights movements is akin to the lack of valid peer-reviewed evidence by people opposing human influenced climate change, vaccines, or GMOs.</p>

<p>CMV why people should either not form their opinions based on scientific consensus, or why scientific consensus in sociological fields should be dismissed or ignored.</p>

<p>Scientists can measure the levels of carbon dioxide throughout history and also differentiate the gas released by burning fossil fuels and from other natural means.</p>

<p>There is a correlation between the fossil fuel carbon dioxide and global temperature that cannot be explained as natural phenomena.</p>

<p>In other words, global warming is real and it is manmade.</p>

<p>Edit: it doesn&#39;t hurt to clarify. I am aware that natural phenomena have first caused global warming and that today it still is a contributing factor (maybe the main one, but that&#39;s not what I wanted to debate). When I say &quot;Global Warming&quot; I am talking about a recent trend over the last 150 years that many scientists attribute to carbon dioxide released from the burning of fossil fuels.</p>

<p>Edit2: I reported a lot of top level comments as breaking rule 1: not challenging my view. The comments were focused on the degree of manmade climate change or what we should do about it. This one is actually pretty simple. To change my view you must convince me that A. The earth is not warming or B. Humans have 0 impact. Some are arguing that the impact is insignificant which is the same as having 0 impact in my opinion.</p>

<p>There are dozens of fronts governments should work on, but a big one is rationing consumption to give the environment a breath.</p>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_23c6l1	CMV: I see no way to justify using public policy to combat climate change regardless of the science.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>In the past century, the American government has tried to fight poverty, racism, terrorism, drugs, and education problems. During the Reagan administration, the government even sought to combat government itself. Has it been successful in any of these ventures? As I see it, very little evidence suggests that it has. My point is that given our track record, isn&#39;t the belief that our government will be able to save the planet a bit too... optimistic?**</p>

<p>To clarify, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a &#39;skeptic&#39; of global warming <em>science</em> in any way, just a skeptic of global warming <em>policy</em>. I think this is a pretty important distinction to make-- the former involves rejecting a scientific consensus, while the latter (at least IMO) is a fairly reasonable political position (full disclosure: I consider myself a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minarchism"">Minarchist</a>). A lot of the climate change articles/posts I see on reddit (<a href=""http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2010/09/face_facts_climate_change_is_u.html"">For example</a>) don&#39;t make that distinction, lumping anyone opposed to environmental legislation into one giant category of &#39;BIGOTS.&#39; </p>

<p>I am quite certain the climate is changing. I also believe humans are very likely a substantial factor in causing/accelerating these changes. I DO NOT, however, think that this automatically implies the need for government action. </p>

<p>**This is the essence of my argument-- government has sucked at pretty much everything it has tried to accomplish in the past 100 years, so how can we expect it to solve perhaps one of the most confounding problems we face as human beings? I introduced my skepticism of &#39;government solutions,&#39; and then applied that point in the context of climate change policy. I now return to that first, more general point. <a href=""http://polisci.duke.edu/uploads/media_items/ppe-working-paper-13-0216.original.pdf"">This</a> essay by Duke professors William Keech and Michael Munger, entitled &quot;The Anatomy of Government Failure,&quot; elaborates on skepticism towards government policy. As Keech &amp; Munger explain, much of the justification of government action comes from identifying and then attempting to solve perceived market failures. And indeed, markets are imperfect-- economic volatility would very much still exist in a truly free market, and the &#39;innovations&#39; used by entrepreneurs in response &quot;turn out to be at least as volatile and subject to bubbles as their earlier predecessors.&quot; And yet, &quot;the same logic applies to government action, and for the same reason. People who dismiss claims about institutional innovation in market are remarkably credulous about the possibilities of reform...&quot; (18). </p>

<p>So go ahead, CMV. As my (current) view is based on a cynicism towards the effectiveness of public policy &#39;solutions,&#39; I guess I would say I&#39;m particularly interested in hearing what people might propose regarding climate change policy that they believe would be (or already is, in the case of existing policies) effective, efficient, and/or reasonable. </p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> I also want to add that I think environmental policy opens up a whole new can of worms with regards to political rent seeking, cronyism, etc., exacerbating the money in politics problem thats been snowballing for the past 80 or so years. </p>

t3_muah4c	CMV: we will never tackle climate change without massively investing in nuclear energy	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Although some countries make be able to rely solely on renewable energies IF (and that&#39;s one hell of an if) new long term energy storage solutions are invented quickly, I don&#39;t think there is a way for most countries to lower their emissions both enough and soon enough without relying on nuclear energy.</p>

<p>I live in France, and here we have quite a high percentage of our electricity (around 10%) comes from hydro and we&#39;re already pretty much at maximum capacity.</p>

<p>There are some wind turbines, but you cannot really rely on constant wind especially inland.</p>

<p>Solar energy is a challenge as some parts of the country only have around 2000 hours of sun a year and land use is already quite high.</p>

<p>The only energy source available with low emissions, controllable and reliable output and low land footprint that is available right now is nuclear energy. It has flaws, sure, but not quite as much as burning shit.</p>

<p>The same can be said for a lot of countries. And keep in mind that if we want to be even remotely close to being carbon neutral, we need to drastically increase our electricity production to be able to power everything that is now running on fossile fuel.</p>

<p>France currently has a low carbon energy, with 70% coming from nuclear energy. With massive investments and collaboration between the countries, others can achieve sililar results in the next few decades.</p>

<p>That being said, I would be delighted to learn that there is another solution, so feel free to share your knowledge.</p>

t3_5dxev7	CMV: A single flat greenhouse gas tax would be better than all enviromental regulations	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The reason climate change is a thing is because of greenhouse gases and its environmental damage. Trying to regulate every aspect that contributes to climate change is inefficient in my mind since there are often ways around it, and there are still other aspects that needs to be regulated (take for example emission limits on cars, even if that&#39;s a thing, there are still factories and fossil fuel plants that pollute). By imposing a single flat greenhouse gas tax, there would be change in incentive to use fossil fuels energy or high emission cars, etc. Energy solutions such as nuclear would be more profitable and new technology would be developed to lower emissions.</p>

<p>This tax would make any greenhouse emitting industry expensive, and could only lead to lower emissions on every aspect that contributes to climate change.</p>

<p>Keep in mind that I identify as moderate libertarian, so a few arguments won&#39;t work on me as well as on someone else.</p>

t3_362ppm	"CMV: All fossil fuel carbon reserves will be used, so it's only a question of time until all the world's carbon is in the air. As a result, bad things will happen."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>More carbon in the air (past a point we&#39;ve already passed) means climate change. There is more carbon in the air now than there has been for millions of years. As carbon-in-air increases, the earth will heat up, with very bad effects on the stability of the environment, leading to large-scale disruptions of human food and water resources, and much death in the ensuring squabbles and relocations. </p>

<p>Why? Because countries compete with one another and are subject to a tragedy of the commons regarding their carbon resources. Moreover, the only way to enforce any international agreement to restrict climate change is through an armed world-government, but that won&#39;t happen. </p>

<p>Carbon emissions reductions might be achieved, but that will only slow down the rate at which oil and coal are burned. A 20% decline in emissions merely slows the inevitable: that all fossil fuels will be consumed. And the very bad scenario of greenhouse gases, rising temperature, and the ensuing cluster is highly likely to occur.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if we slow down the emissions rate far enough (like, almost to zero), forests and algae will recapture the carbon. But I don&#39;t think that&#39;s going to happen as long as national economies (and militaries!) are competing with one another. Or if we develop a hugely efficient power source that makes burning coal, oil, and natural gas a relative waste of time. But I don&#39;t think John Galt or cold fusion will come along in time.</p>

<p>Oh, and there&#39;s no chance that the leading military powers (whoever they are, now or in the future) will allow a world-government sufficiently militarized to enforce its climate control directives.</p>

<p>In short: at best, emissions reductions strategies merely delay the inevitable use of all carbon fuel. I think we&#39;re pretty screwed. Please goodness, change my view.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Take sub-Saharan Africa for example. Currently there is not much industrialization in this region, but there are <strong>vast deposits</strong> of untapped resources (e.g. iron ore, tin, copper, coal), extremely fertile arable land, and a largely untapped labor force (roughly 1 billion people).</p>

<p>Eventually, wages in eastern and south-east Asia (e.g. China, Vietnam) will rise so much that companies will look elsewhere for &quot;cheap labor&quot;. When that time comes, companies will start to look seriously at Africa. Africa will industrialize and the standard of living there will increase as the people become more wealthy.  </p>

<p>The western world will protest against African nations building <strong>hundreds of new coal-fired power plants</strong>, as they have protested this in China, but ultimately will not be able to stop it.</p>

<p>Sub-Saharan Africa is <strong>just one of many examples</strong> around the world of where this will occur.  This example includes about 1 billion people.  There are many people in other regions of the world that demand a better standard of living than abject poverty too, and will work to make it happen when given the chance.</p>

<p>Global climate change will happen on a scale that the eclipses what we are seeing today.  Due to human nature, this is an <strong>unstoppable inevitability</strong> and fighting against it is a waste of time and resources that could be spent better elsewhere.  CMV.</p>

t3_oa8n42	CMV: Either the record high temperatures in the Northwest U.S. are NOT evidence of global warming or the record low temperatures in the Midwest 16 months ago ARE evidence against it. You can't have it both ways.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Whenever we have a regionalized heat wave in, global warming alarmist start <a href=""https://www.newsweek.com/heat-dome-over-pacific-northwest-sign-future-says-global-warming-expert-1604477"">showing up in the media</a> about &quot;seeeeee... I told you there was global warming!&quot;</p>

<p>But just 16 months ago, we were seeing all-time <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/16/us/record-cold-weather-us-trnd/index.html"">record low temperatures in areas of Arkansas and Nebraska</a>.  Anyone who made a comment about &quot;where our global warming now&quot; during that cold snap would have been met with a retort of &quot;WeaTHeR is NoT ClIMatE&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>This is not a CMV</strong> about whether or not global warming exists, whether is is caused by humans, or <strong>about climate change</strong> at all.  It is a view about the hypocrisy of global warming alarmists using regional heat waves to support their argument while dismissing regionalized cold snaps that counter their argument.  It&#39;s the same damn thing.  Either they&#39;re both evidence, or neither is evidence.</p>

<p><em>Edit</em>:  To bold specific portions of the final paragraph.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong>  Delta awarded to  <a href=""/u/roylennigan"">/u/roylennigan</a>.  While others tried (before and after him/her) to explain this, his/her post was the one that enlightened me.  I was of the understanding that &quot;global warming&quot; was an old, discarded term that climate change alarmists were trying to discard because it wasn&#39;t as defensible as &quot;climate change&quot;.  The term climate change can be used for just about anything:  hotter, colder, windier, rainier, dryer, more hurricanes, less hurricanes, etc. etc. etc. - it can all be explained as generic &quot;climate change&quot;.  But explaining all those as &quot;global warming&quot; doesn&#39;t really seem to jive with common sense.  &quot;Warming&quot; really only explains away one thing:  increasing temperatures.</p>

<p>But, as it turns out, (at least for some people) &quot;global warming&quot; isn&#39;t an old, discarded marketing term.  Global warming is actually alive and well and is something different and distinct from &quot;climate change&quot;.  If you read my response to  <a href=""/u/roylennigan"">/u/roylennigan</a>, you&#39;ll see the details of how one theory points to global warming causing a chain reaction that leads to alterations in the jet stream and eventually to cold snaps like the one we saw in the Midwest in February.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t feel too badly about having this misconception as it&#39;s not something I&#39;ve ever really looked into and several of the responses to this CMV repeated my misconception that global warming is the simply the old name for climate change.  I think the biggest challenge in the climate change debate is the communication.  You&#39;ve got scientific research being summarized by media (frequently, biased media) that is then politicized by governments and politicians.  Without the interest to filter through the politics and media, and go directly to the science itself (which is also sometimes influenced by it&#39;s own biases and self-interests), it&#39;s nearly impossible for the average lay person to to actually know the data and it&#39;s reliability.  Which means most people resort to simply believing whomever supports the &quot;side&quot; they&#39;ve already chosen.</p>

<p>So logically, I must ask myself, why am I taking the view that Climate Change is real?

t3_c9t80v	CMV: Individual lifestyle changes are not sufficient to save us from the climate crisis	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The 2018 IPCC report (that has been criticised by some climate scientists for being too conservative in its estimates of how much change needs to occur) says that we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions globally by 45% by 2030 to keep long-term temperature increase below 1.5 C - a level that would be extremely harmful to the environment but not catastrophic. If we fail, human civilisation as we know it could crumble and millions or even billions of people will be severely negatively impacted.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And I&#39;m convinced we will fail, unless top-down change occurs now.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It isn&#39;t impossible for those in the west to cut their emissions by 45%. Becoming vegan, stopping flying, buying an electric car and fitting solar panels will probably achieve it. For the sake of argument, say that for the 25% most polluting individuals, a 90% cut in emissions is manageable (though it would be costly and remove many pleasures from life) by 2030. To reduce this groups emissions by 45%, half of this group would have to reduce their emissions by 90% whilst the other half kept their&#39;s level.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Sounds possible? Yes. Just about, especially given that if more people reduce their emissions, each individual only has to reduce their emissions less (if all of the 25% reduce their emissions, then they only have to do so by 45%). This would <em>still</em> require huge social change across the west that is unlikely to occur given the difficulties and costs involved in reducing CO2 emissions by this much. You can&#39;t stop flying if it is absolutely necessary for your job, and veganism can be especially difficult for those with further dietary conditions.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>But we&#39;ve forgotten the remaining 75% of the world&#39;s population. Whilst this group emits less emissions per capita than the 25%, <em>they also need to reduce their emissions by 45%</em>. This group have lower emissions to start with, so need to reduce their emissions by less, but it will be a lot harder for them to reduce their emissions. They are generally significantly poorer than the 25%, and live in areas with less infrastructure. You can&#39;t drive an electric car in an area without a stable electricity grid. You can&#39;t become vegan if you&#39;re a subsistence herder. You can&#39;t stop flying if you don&#39;t already fly. You can&#39;t afford to buy greener products if you&#39;re already choosing whether to pay for rent or food each week.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>It gets worse. Over the next decade, many in the bottom 75% will become richer. They&#39;ll have more money to spend, and will (acceptably) use it to increase their quality of life. This will certainly increase their emissions. This then has to be balanced through even greater emissions cuts from the rest of us, and the more emissions you cut, the harder it is to reduce your emissions further.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>And we can&#39;t stop at 2030 either. We&#39;ve got to keep decreasing our emissions after then. As I said before, it will just get harder and harder.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Personal actions are pointless, unless those personal actions are demanding that governments actually do something about this (say, close all fossil fuel power stations, open (carbon neutral) factories to build electric cars and faster trains and ban flying).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I want to be wrong, and I want my choices to mean something. Can someone please convince me they will?</p>

<p>Ending deforestation of the rainforests. We want to preserve the habitat of rare animals and the natural beauty.</p>

<p>Improving public transportation. Traffic congestion is a bitch, and if I had a subway or rail system nearby to take me where I needed to go, I would love it. Cars are expensive and require your attention for the duration of your commute.</p>

<p>This is by no means an exhaustive list, but definitely the big ones I&#39;ve seen a lot. It&#39;s possible that there&#39;s some other action being recommended for climate change that I&#39;ve overlooked or forgotten. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t believe that destroying the coal industry to grow green energy industries is a bad thing. So if you have a view of the financial aspect that&#39;s not protecting a certain industry that&#39;s more than welcome as well!</p>

t3_2l73tk	"CMV: Our current ""world leaders"" are incapable of the necessary change required to avert climate change."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>In light of the most recent <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/"">IPCC report</a> and my own reading of <a href=""http://www.chelseagreen.com/bookstore/item/extracted:paperback"">Ugo Bardi&#39;s <em>Extracted</em></a> it seems clear to me that the only way to avert <strong>more</strong> climate related disasters and catastrophic economic change is to immediately push our economy to be more decentralized and distributed.</p>

<p>My view, which I wish to discuss, is that our current &quot;world leaders&quot; are not going to be able to make the sweeping systematic changes required to make this <em>inevitable</em> shift in our economy. Any changes they will propose will be weak and impotent. I believe that it is within their power to do what needs to be done, but they lack:</p>

<ul>
<li>The political <strong>courage</strong> to stand up against the institutional (aka corporate, private or monied) power.</li>
<li>The <strong>will</strong> to dismantle and distribute their own political power</li>
<li>The <strong>trust</strong> that other leaders will do the same</li>
</ul>

<p>The assumption I am making is that a <strong>massive restructuring of the economy is going to happen</strong>. Infinite growth is an insane way to operate on a finite planet and <em>is</em> going to stop and decline if not collapse. </p>

<p>My fear is that people keep waiting for &quot;world leaders&quot; to do something to soften this transition, to fix this problem, which they are not able to fix.</p>

<p>Change is coming and if we wait for the &quot;world leaders&quot; to lead we will find ourselves following the change, rather than guiding it.</p>

<p>EDIT: great discussion, but very few people even touched on my point. I don&#39;t feel that anyone convinced me that world leaders are going to be able to deal with climate change. It seems clear that we, citizens of the world, will be leading the change. Good luck out there.</p>

t3_3dt3vy	CMV:Climate change should be the dominant international issue for politicians and activists today.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Scientists widely accept that climate change is real. Consequently, they say that it will lead to extreme weather, a raise in the sea level, increased acidity of the ocean, reduced sea and ice cover, and drought. These effects will in turn impact not only human&#39;s general well-being, but will also displace coastal settlements and cities, negatively effect food sources, destroy ecosystems, and more.
Furthermore,</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;It is increasingly evident that the policy actions by these countries and others will not be enough to stave off a rise in the atmospheric temperature of 2 degrees Celsius, or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit. At that point, scientists say, the planet will be locked into a future of extreme storms, droughts, food and water shortages, and rising sea levels.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, I think the number one concern for the human race as a whole should be climate change, and I find it hard to justify any other causes. Yes, human rights and the economy are important, immediate concerns--But, in the end, it won&#39;t matter in if the planet becomes uninhabitable. So climate change and efforts to reverse or combat it should be the dominant issue in the world now. Instead, of focusing on raising the minimum wage or gay rights, we should devote most of our resources and energy to solving climate change.
I&#39;m liberal. I think there are tons of important issues that we need to address--education, gun control, mental health, women&#39;s rights--but these issues should be secondary to protecting our home.</p>

t3_jhsw4y	CMV: Vegetarianism is a prerequisite for environmentalism	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I think that to promote environmentally progressive policies without being vegetarian is hypocritical. Vegetarianism is easily followed in almost all countries, and in almost all cases, is perfectly healthy. (Pregnancy might be an exception). Across a range of metrics, vegetarianism is better for the environment, and has additional benefits of reducing animal cruelty and likely health benefits e.g. reducing consumption of processed meats.</p>

<p>It also adds market demand for vegetarian products, menus and potentially even synthetic meat substitutes.</p>

<p>Vegetarianism is a broad category, and can be environmentally problematic if fish and dairy replace meat. But presuming an environmental motive, adherents should be aware of these pitfalls, and manage their diet appropriately.</p>

<p>But if the platform is new, the use which humans do of it is always directed by market forces which are on their own directed by our nature (see for example how the vast majority of the internet is pornographic content).</p>

<p>Our nature is to compare ourselves with others and the internet has exacerbated this phenomenon and literally have it run wild</p>

<p>If you are a small owner trying to provide for your family you have the Bezos 200B net worth in your face all the times, if you are a girl trying to feel cute about her body..then you have Emily Ratajowski  in your face, again, all the time</p>

<p>And our nature, by the way, is not to look away and don&#39;t pay attention to our competitors but to keep head down and grind to eventually reach #1 and finally be happy. But the notion of #1 implies that there can only be only one winner and 7,999,999,999 losers at this game.</p>

<p>So we are already seeing a comparison induced depression state across the board, but this is nothing yet compared with what&#39;s about to hit us. It will hit us from the inside , unlike any external enemy and it will be global</p>

<p>You think the current situation is bad? It&#39;s  still seen nothing compared to the violence of an enemy which we can&#39;t even study and have no hope of defeating. </p>

<p>At least with climate as well as the current situation we know what we should do to solve the problem (it&#39;s more a matter of getting our act together and doing it), but with this particular enemy (comparison induced depression) there&#39;s nothing we can do.

t3_4kpy8a	CMV: It is hypocritical and dangerous for Donald Trump to publicly denounce the science of climate change while privately taking measures to protect his properties from climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Donald Trump has repeatedly called the science behind climate change into question, denouncing it as a hoax that will make American businesses less competitive. He has also vowed to renegotiate international agreements meant to curb the output of greenhouse gases.</p>

<p>As a private business owner, Donald Trump&#39;s company recently filed papers seeking permission to build a wall to protect one of his golf courses on the coast of Ireland from coastal erosion caused by rising sea-levels. According to Politico &quot;The statement acknowledges one Irish government study that assumes a steady rate of erosion through 2050, but argues that the study fails to account for the effects of climate change: &#39;If the predictions of an increase in sea level rise as a result of global warming prove correct, however, it is likely that there will be a corresponding increase in coastal erosion rates not just in Doughmore Bay but around much of the coastline of Ireland. In our view, it could reasonably be expected that the rate of sea level rise might become twice of that presently occurring. … As a result, we would expect the rate of dune recession to increase.” If Donald Trump truly believed that climate change was a hoax, then he would not want to spend extra money as a private businessman to protect himself from the (not real) risks of climate change.</p>

t3_9un4b6	CMV: Most of the current efforts to 'solve' global warming are a complete waste of time	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Global warming is a massive issue. Unchecked it could literally wipe out civilization as we know it.  We&#39;re already experiencing some negative effects from it (probably to a greater degree than we actually realize) and this is only going to exponentially grow. We&#39;ve already moved past multiple &#39;tipping points&#39; or &#39;last chances&#39; to sort it out yet CO2 emissions actually continue to grow. Developing nations like India China, Indonesia, Nigeria will see that continue (fair enough considering us Western Nations also benefited from coal etc. Even our own industry/business continues to release so many gasses it&#39;s almost unbelievable (look up the CO2 emissions of large ships).</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>In the face of this problem most of our solutions are so small. On an individual level using a bike/public transport, choosing to become a vegetarian/vegan or getting solar panels have a completely negligible effect (even if millions upon millions are making these changes). Even on a country level instituting a carbon tax or investing more in renewable energy (at least in a non-drastic way) barely makes a scratch. Particularly for smaller countries. Even if these movements continue to majorly ramp up (at least in Western countries) we won&#39;t even come close to turning this ship. A fair few people actually believe this but take it in a different way (imo a more pessimistic way), believing that it just means we&#39;re doomed.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t. Scientific/technological advancement is incredible.  What we as a collective have achieved with the internet, mobile phones, computers, air-planes, space-flight, medicine and hundreds of other areas in relatively short spans of times is awe-inspiring. Yet some CO2 in the atmosphere is going to be the end of us? I mean come on, have some faith in science.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Global warming is definitely a problem we have to solve and we need to continue to put pressure on governments to pump money into science to fix it, (which incidentally they&#39;ll do themselves once we start feeling more serious effects from climate change) but all these individual efforts are just a complete waste of time. There&#39;s some value in &#39;being the change you want to see&#39; and &#39;setting an example&#39; but we&#39;d be much better off saving our time and money and putting more pressure on big business/government who actually have the ability to solve the problem.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>EDIT: While I haven&#39;t found anyone that has dissuaded me from my view that science is a far and away better option than relying on incremental change from individuals (and hence should be prioritized at all costs) I have opened my eyes a little more to the value of these small changes while science continues along in the background as measures taken &#39;just in case&#39; that generally are beneficial to the person anyway. </p>

<p>Am pretty steadfast in my opinion though that the view that incremental change on a global scale will enact changes quick enough is driven by just as much faith as my view about science. I just cannot see how these changes transition from rich westerners and go global in time for any sort of real preventative measures to be taken.</p>

t3_j148v3	CMV: If climate change is a major issue for you as an American voter then logically you should vote for Biden in the upcoming elections.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I will assume &quot;you&quot; are a voter in the USA. If climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, environmental regulations, etc. are major issues that you think the federal government should take action to alleviate then logically you should vote for Biden in the elections. There are two reasons that lead to my conclusion:</p>

<p>1) Only Biden or Trump will be elected president. If one of them dies, then Harris or Pence will become president and most likely have policies that closely align with Biden/Trump respectively.
2) Biden&#39;s environmental platform is far superior to Trump&#39;s. </p>

<p>For more elaboration on #2, here are some articles that give evidence for Trump&#39;s horrible stance on the environment:</p>

<p><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/climate/alaska-oil-drilling-anwr.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/17/climate/alaska-oil-drilling-anwr.html</a></p>

<p>Biden&#39;s environmental plan: <a href=""https://joebiden.com/climate-plan"">https://joebiden.com/climate-plan</a></p>

<p>It is important to note that in my view, even if you favor policies that would create a larger &quot;green new deal&quot; or set more stringent mandates than what Biden&#39;s platform includes then you should still vote for Biden in this election. If you choose to vote for the Green party or not vote for anyone, than you are ignoring the fact that there are only two options at this point for who will become president(point 1).</p>

<p>To change my view, you will simply need to convince me that point 1 or 2 is incorrect. The reason I made this CMV is because I see some people who do care about the environment say that Biden does not go far enough on environmental issues or that it won&#39;t make a difference who wins and that they will then vote third party or abstain. To me this does not make logical sense and is based more on an emotional decision because they would rather have someone other than Biden be the democrats&#39; nominee.</p>

(I am a senior in high school living in a non-coastal area in the U.S)</p>

<p>The Earth has already risen by 1°C, and it will only continue to rise. At the very least, by the time humans stop contributing to global warming, we will already be screwed. </p>

<ol>
<li><p><strong>Developing nations cannot suddenly become environmentally friendly.</strong> We may be able to mitigate it to some extent, but it is unlikely that any developing nations would choose to pass any extreme laws regarding the environment. For instance, China is #1 in CO2 emissions, and India is #3. If either of these countries were forced to pass laws that restrict activities that contribute to global warming, then there would likely be many lost jobs and the economy would fall under. Any countries that rely on workers from such countries would have increased production costs, resulting in inflated prices globally. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Phytoplankton may be affected by ocean pH changes, resulting in less CO2 consumption.</strong> Due to higher levels of CO2 dissolved in ocean waters, many organisms are susceptible to dying due to unfavorable living conditions. The primary concern that I have with this is the effect it will have on phytoplankton, which produces around half of the Earth&#39;s oxygen (and consequently, consumes quite a bit of CO2). If there is an issue with the phytoplankton, then I would assume that the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere would only continue to increase, even if we lower the output that we are emitting. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Coastal city flooding:</strong> I don&#39;t believe we can prevent it at this point, and it&#39;s also likely that we will receive more extreme weather. San Francisco, L.A., NYC, Boston, and many other major cities would be affected in some way, which would inevitably lead to a weakened economy (for the entire nation) as well as many deaths.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The biggest reason why I believe we are screwed, however, is that global warming is, for the time being, irreversible. </p>

<p>This whole outlook is making me pretty depressed about the future, please CMV!</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;ve been convinced, thanks for all of the great replies! This was my first CMV so my first delta was probably made too quickly, but <a href=""/u/compounding"">u/compounding</a> provided a lot of reasons for me to be more optimistic about the future.</p>

t3_hxxntu	"CMV: If you truly believe that climate change is an existential threat but you still live like a first world citizen, you either selfishly don’t think it will significantly affect you, or you are a hypocrite."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>If you have access to internet and a grocery store, you almost definitely produce more greenhouse gasses than the acceptable per capita requirements, both directly and indirectly. The very fact that most of us live in a first world consumption based economy means that everything we buy and use requires extensive supply chains and transport lines, all of which produce greenhouse gasses. As an example, the CO2 emissions per capita for USA is about 15 tons per annum, compared to a country like Liberia, at 0.18 (these numbers may not be exactly up to date for 2020, but still accurately reflect the order of magnitude of the difference between countries).</p>

<p>How can we justify this standard of living, knowing that we are directly contributing to climate change? Even if we try to divert the blame to large companies, we all still use products that these companies produce. If you are not completely boycotting companies that emit excessive  greenhouses gasses, you are not doing enough.</p>

<p>Following this logic, people like Greta Thunberg are probably one of the only people who are actually making the appropriate level of effort in this space.</p>

<p>Yes, I include myself in my original statement even though I recycle, avoid disposable plastics, and reduce my meat consumption. If I was really committed, I would be moving to a third world country and living off the land. The reason that I don’t do that is because I am selfish, and prioritizing my comfort above that of future generations. What is yours?</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Edit 1: In response to a few comments, I have never said that everyone who lives like a first class citizen is a hypocrite. Only those who believe in man-made climate change being an existential threat, produce excessive CO2 emissions, and <strong><em>do not</em></strong> think that they should reduce their greenhouse emissions.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>Edit 2: Many comments say that individual responses don&#39;t significantly affect climate change. This is true, but it does not make it acceptable. You are still prioritizing your own comfort above future generations. You are still assisting government and corporation inactivity through your own inactivity and support of the status quo. For lack of a better word, I would still say you are being selfish in that regard.</p>

t3_ehw13c	CMV: Disregarding Economists' consensus on things like free trade and corporate taxes demonstrates the same ignorance as disregarding Climate Scientists' consensus on climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>If one believes (as I do) that we should believe experts when a consensus is reached on an issue within their field, which at least on reddit is generally accepted on issues like vaccination and climate change, it is inconsistent to not apply this pattern to economics as well.</p>

<p>It seems to me that economics and climate science especially have a particular set of features in common. Both rely heavily on the creation of mathematical models based on past data. The fields attempt to predict future events based on these models making revisions as new data arrives and the models are shown to be consistent or inconsistent.</p>

<p>To be clear. I am not of the opinion that we should believe every economist or economic theory, only that when a broad consensus exists, it should be treated with the same consideration as other fields, such as climate science.</p>

<p>Furthermore, I am not necessarily of the opinion that every such policy be enacted, there may be non-economic reasons not do so. However, we should accept proposed economic consequences as likely being true.</p>

<p>In comparison there are non-environmental reasons not to enact a policy that climate scientists know would be good for the environment (e.g. getting rid of cattle). But the basic premise &quot;X would be good for the environment&quot; should be generally accepted by reasonable non-experts.</p>

<p>I am extremely unlikely to find arguments against climate change convincing or relevant.</p>

<p>I am also unlikely to be convinced by an argument against any specific economic policy. I do not have a background in economics. You are unlikely to be able to teach me enough economics in a single post to think I understand the issue better than the entire field of Economists. Just the same as I am likely to be swayed on climate science by a post arguing against global warming, not having a sufficient background in climate science.</p>

<p>This is a rather new opinion of mine and am posting because, so far, I can&#39;t find any major faults with it and it represents a fairly major adjustment in my worldview.</p>

<p>Edit: I awarded a delta based on an argument that there are less consistent laws that economics models must follow that may make modelling less reliable, however, I want to mention that my delta is awarded on economics potentially not being comparable to climate science. I still believe that people should generally accept the consensus of experts even in the social sciences (sociologists on sociology, psychologists on psychology, economists on economics).</p>

<p>Edit 2: Please stop trying to argue there is never a consensus unless you have a more reliable source than the <a href=""http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel"">Chicago Booth IGM Experts Panels</a></p>

<p>Edit 3: I am unlikely to find arguments for Austrian Economics convincing.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve never understood what the big deal is about climate change. To me, it&#39;s just part of the natural order of things since we as humans are in fact natural beings. We have an impact on the planet the same way any other species does. In fact, and I admit I&#39;ve stolen this from George Carlin, I think it&#39;s possible that the planet is stronger than humanity anyway. How do we know that Earth won&#39;t right itself in a few thousand years? And why are humans so egotistical to think we can change mother nature anyway? I&#39;m open to change my opinion but I&#39;ve never heard a compelling reason.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I plan on never having kids so the &quot;your great grandchildren&quot; thing doesn&#39;t apply to me...</p>

<p>Edit: A lot of great convo going on here, didn&#39;t expect this many responses. Hard to keep up/not get points crossed, doing my best. First time poster on these parts.</p>

<p>Edit 2: I noticed a few misleading word choices on my part so I&#39;m cleaning that up. </p>

<p>First, &quot;right itself&quot; wasn&#39;t what I meant. I meant to say Earth will take on whatever new paradigm is created by climate change. Maybe that does mean wiping us off the planet so we can&#39;t harm it anymore. We, as a species, aren&#39;t entitled to life on this planet. We&#39;re just...here.</p>

<p>Second, &quot;change mother nature&quot; is basically the same idea. Ultimately, the course of mother nature is stronger than whatever we do to it. If we harm it in such a way that means we as a species cease to exist, that will be because Earth had a negative reaction to us being here. Maybe that means our atmosphere is no longer habitable, killing us off. Maybe that means we&#39;ve created too much physical pollution where we run out of space to live. </p>

<p>Related to that last bit, it&#39;s instinctual to want to survive. I guess maybe I don&#39;t have that instinct on a broad scale? Not sure, that seems too unpredictable to either make it part of my point or change it. </p>

t3_3ek50g	CMV:people will only take climate change seriously once a lot of people die	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>i believe the only way climate change will be taken seriously will be when thousands of people will die</p>

<p>1)climate change is considered an &quot;invisible force&quot;, that is there are few physical signs that show that the Earth&#39;s climate is changing. the only physical signs will be through natural disasters (hurricanes, floods, droughts). no matter how many times a scientist will go on the news to say climate change is real, people won&#39;t change the way they live their lives. </p>

<p>2)relating to the first point the amount of these natural disasters need to happen frequently. for example, hurricane sandy caused 65 million dollars of damages and occurred in late October. yet climate deniers will say it was just a freak accident that occurs every couple decades or so. they will probably mention a powerful natural disaster in the 50s or so and say &quot;was climate change happening then??&quot; like a scrap on the knee, people will just put a band-aid over it and give it time to heal, but if these scraps happen in rapid session people will realize they can&#39;t take it anymore</p>

<p>3)people only care about things that affect them. if there was a law that made its citizens use environmental friendly trash bags and to recycle, they would flip out. why would people care that polar bears, dolphins, bees ,etc. are dying? </p>

t3_6x76p6	CMV: Market-based economies are flawed because they lack any mechanisms to address negative externalities. Government regulations only act as a bandage solution and do not efficiently prevent long-term negative externalities (such as global warming and vast economic inequality).	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Anyone who has taken basic econ 101 knows that a negative externality is the consequence of economic activity that is experienced by an unrelated third party. The textbook example is pollution --- An oil company only factors in their internal financial cost of operation, basing their prices solely on supply and demand. If pollution occurs, the costs associated with that problem, such as cleanup, are usually not factored in. They are external costs that are usually imposed on the public without their consent. Even worse, is that sometimes these externalities are so grave that they cannot be solved by imposing the cost on the public, as the externality exceeds any conceivable price. In many cases damage is irreversible, posing serious threats to entire ecosystems and to public health. And while certain industries or even specific companies can be sourced to certain problems, with legal actions taken to get them to change their behaviour or cover costs, the deeper problems are those that cannot be easily linked to any single company or industry. They are system-level problems that are generated by inherent principles of market-based economies.</p>

<p>When we consider overall pollution, inequality, poverty, resource depletion, species extinction, loss of biodiversity, reductions in public health, civil conflict, behavioural violence, overall structural violence, and other pervasive social and ecological problems, we are looking at consequences not of one person, one institution, or one industry. We are looking at problems literally produced by market behaviour itself. These problems are really categories of problems, with one externality triggering many others. For example, imagine a company that over the courser of years pollutes a water source to save money on proper disposal. That polluted water is linked to a towns water supply, leading some people to get cancer, not knowing why. In one family, this pollution leads to the sickness and death of a father. Since the father was the breadwinner, the window is now trying to afford to take care of the two kids. This financial strain increases their debt, with the oldest child unable to attend college, as he needs to help support the family, ect. You can see how chain reactions spread in complexity and are difficult to track due to unforeseen consequences linked to negative externalities. </p>

<p>So i guess my question is that why do we constantly try to reform and regulate market-economies given their inherent predispositions to create life-threatening negative externalities? Would it not be more prudent to distribute resources based on scientific, ecological and public-health related principles instead of distributing resources solely based on supply and demand? I am wrong to worry about this? Are negative externalities that problematic? If you think they aren&#39;t then explain why and CMV!</p>

<p>Climate change is happening and will likely have pretty devastating effects on the world in the coming decades. Massive droughts, sea level rise, rise in temperatures and natural disasters, etc.</p>

<p>I think I understand what the likely negatives of these will be but I was thinking that if someone had enough money, say even as &#39;low&#39; as 1 million in assets they would more or less be sheltered from the majority of these negatives. </p>

<p>One small example, droughts are going to screw up a lot of places. Africa will likely be in much worse state in the coming decades than it is now. With the drought will come famine, etc. Food prices will go up globally which will either lead people to starve or significantly effect their lives. If someone had a lot of means this would likely cause little to no impact on their lives. </p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Let my start off by saying I don&#39;t know enough to make an informed view on if anthropogenic climate change is happening, however that isn&#39;t what this post is about. I don&#39;t believe the study of climate change can be considered science because it is not <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falsifiability"">falsifiable</a>. Karl Popper argued that if a scientific theory is not falsifiable it is pseudoscience because it cannot be proven untrue. When Einstein proposed his theory of relativity he argued it could be falsified if the either principle of relativity, the constancy of the speed of light, or time dilation could be shown to be false. Several subsequent experiment proved these prediction and the theory of relativity became accepted as &quot;true&quot;.</p>

<p>Anthropogenic climate change cannot be falsified. Most climate models predicition have been <a href=""http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/11/report-95-percent-of-global-warming-models-are-wrong/"">wrong</a> (I apologize for the source). I remember in 2005 every climate scientist was claiming we would have more hurricanes as the Earth warms and then a few years later when the number of hurricanes declined they claimed a warming Earth would reduce the number of hurricanes. What I&#39;m getting at is that no matter how many times the models and prediction are falsified they are simply revised to match the new data. The underlying theory and method are new questioned. Even if I were to show that the Earth is cooling that could fit under the banner of climate change. There is a reason global warming changed to climate change. </p>

<p>The Earth cannot be controlled like a science experiment. Even if the Earth is warming it is impossible to determine if humans have caused the change in climate, or the sun, or the Earth&#39;s tilt, or a combination of all of them. It&#39;s difficult to know if changes in CO2 are a leading or trailing indication of warming. Even the raw data is manipulated in various ways to fix error but it also could work to confirm the result. No matter what the raw data shows, it can be shoehorned to fit into the global warming theory. Even the lack of warming over the last 15 years can be <a href=""http://dx.doi.org/10.4236/ojs.2014.47050"">explained away</a> as a statsitical anomaly. Unless there is an experiment that could be conducted that disproved climate change it is pseudoscience. </p>

<p>I also believe that the energy intensive lifestyles of individuals have a non-negligible effect on our climate change situation and that our personal choices lead to loss of life and livelihood for those communities most affected by climate change.</p>

<p>I understand that many people are locked-in to the bulk of these individual choices and cannot easily or significantly change the extent to which they contribute to overall carbon emissions. By this I mean that, although there are many changes that need to be made to the ways we organize our food, transportation, waste, and infrastructure systems, we all still need to eat, get to work, get rid of wastes, and hear our houses and public building.</p>

<p>I understand that aviation is a very significant contributor to personal carbon emissions for anyone who participates in international air travel on a regular basis (1+/year) and that, furthermore, it is in no way necessary for the survival or basic well-being of individuals. According the the sources I have read, aviation is both significantly more carbon-emitting than other forms of transportation per unit of distance and more likely to involve extremely large distances.</p>

<p>Therefore, I believe that to engage in long-distance pleasure air travel is to contribute to climate change entirely needlessly and to therefore willingly contribute to loss of life and livelihood in regions affected by climate change. There are few other low-hanging fruit that combine high carbon emissions with utter frivolity and I believe that, if we are going to begin addressing the global issues of climate change and climate justice, we need to begin curtailing international pleasure travel. In our society taking large and frequent airplane trips is seen as something to be looked up to and admired. Nonsensically something as trivial as being rude to a stranger is seen as being more immoral than taking part in a frivolous activity that definitely does lead to human death and suffering. </p>

<p>Basically, this is an entirely fringe opinion, and just about everyone I have spoken to about it becomes extremely defensive (I never bring it up aggressively, but sometimes explain to people why I do not want to take part in air travel). I think that it is a fundamental lie that capitalism has told us that individuals have the right to do anything they want if they can afford it, and damn the repercussions for people and the environment.</p>

<p>Maybe you can change my view? I am a little set in my ways on this, but people disagree so vigorously that I figure I might as well receive well reasoned counter arguments.</p>

If these things (which are between quotation marks to show they are not my ideas ) were articulated, argued for and against, maybe the stress level would drop.(Maybe that would be bad for business, less media selling). Why do the media (and so the  buyers of those media) skip the minimal rational information about these controversies? How come the only way people think it has to be handled - it is mass demonstrations (which may turn violent)?  </p>

t3_c0ba4k	CMV: Embracing nuclear power is the only viable way to address this issue of climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Ok, so on the face of it this my not appear to be a particularly controversial opinion, but it actually kinda is. I’ve had many experiences, albeit anecdotally, with green ‘activists’ (and on a couple of occasions Green Party councillors) emphasising their total opposition to nuclear power. This is in fact quite a pervasive opinion even within groups focused on addressing the issues posed by climate change (and I’m sure the recent tv series Chernobyl won’t help matters!).</p>

<p>So, a couple of things about nuclear power:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It is a safe form of renewable energy generation. The major accident in the history of nuclear power generation was a fatal design flaw motivated by a lack of money and occurred within a closed state system. Modern reactors are extremely safe, albeit quite expensive.</p></li>
<li><p>Next generation nuclear reactors are even more efficient, require less maintenance and have more resilient cooling systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear fuel is abundant. </p></li>
<li><p>Nuclear power creates reliable, well paid jobs. This is true across the supply chain and also in nuclear decommissioning can create jobs in deprived communities. This could be one of the ways to regenerate former manufacturing communities that have been hit hard by globalisation.</p></li>
<li><p>Investment in a swathe of new reactors and standardisation can cut the cost of renewing plants.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Ok, and in terms of the problems with other forms of renewables:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Most forms of renewable energy are inefficient, less reliable and do not provide 24/7 energy generation.</p></li>
<li><p>Renewables relying on photovoltaic panels, wind generators and batteries are resource intensive and less environmentally friendly as they require extracting cobalt and lithium in substantial quantities. </p></li>
<li><p>In the USA in 2017, nuclear energy provided 805 TWh of power (around 20% of the total). Other renewables, excluding hydropower, provided 387 TWh, or 9.6% of the total.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Nuclear power is reliable, creates jobs and generates more energy than any other form of renewable. Countries such as the US are decommissioning a high number of their nuclear plants and need to invest in renewing these investing in more plants if they are serious about reducing emissions.</p>

t3_dqvhyy	"CMV: Pressuring developing nations to shift away from fossil fuel is not constructive, we should be pressuring developed nations to build FREE green tech in developing nations."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Following the UN climate summit, there is a lot of international discussion around shifting away from CO2 emission in methods such as cutting down on fossil fuel usage by switching to green tech and green energy. There was also the reaffirmation and push to follow through on the Paris Climate Accords of reaching net 0 carbon emission by 2050.</p>

<p>However, I believe that it is useless to just tell many of the nations in the world to go off on their own and try and hit that goal. This would be simply unwise or impossible for some nations. In the current global state, oil is still the largest source of energy and there is already developed infrastructure for using oil. The same cannot be said for green and renewable energy. Many developing nations simply do not have the money to spend on the large scale infrastructure projects needed to transition to green energy.</p>

<p>It is also not very fair for developed nation, who reached their status by using these harmful energy sources to then turn around and force less developed nations without the power or resources to make meaningful change.</p>

<p>Luckily, there is a way to combat and change this. We can make change by having developed nation invest FREE green tech into these developing nations, so their people (who were often the victims of the developed nations) could enjoy green energy and cut down on their CO2 emissions while also not having to burden huge bills on top of their already difficult situations.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this is not happening in the status quo. Very few developed nations are actually involved in developing green tech in developing nations, and all those that do does not build the projects for free. Most of these projects comes at a cost for the country they are located in whether is be in the forms of a loan or the takeover of local industries and property.</p>

<p>By making the green tech completely free, we benefit not only the citizens of these developing nations by cutting down on their electricity cost, but also the entire world by reducing CO2 emissions.</p>

<p>Side note: It is also important to recognize, however, that the majority of CO2 emission is not from these nations but from just 100 multinational corporations. <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change"">https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change</a></p>

<p>If we want to solve climate change, we must pressure these corporations and hold them responsible for their actions.</p>

t3_6ff500	CMV: Americans tend to have large carbon footprints and are therefor one of the leading forces in climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I am not interested in debating if humans are linked to causing climate change.  So let&#39;s just assume they 100% are.</p>

<p>Americans have larger carbon footprints than people of other nations are therefore the leading cause of many environmental problems including climate change.</p>

<p>Now.. you might argue that factories in China pump crap into the air - but who gets their stuff manufactured in those factories?  American companies that&#39;s who.. or.. who buys stuff made in those factories?  Americans!</p>

<p>Americans also tend to eat more meat than people of other nations and we all know that beef in particular is a leading problem for the environment (mostly because of the deforestation of the land in order to make room for grazing or to grow crops for cattle).</p>

<p>Americans often have large families - and of course more people = more problems because you create more consumers.  Admittedly in some countries people have more kids than the average American, but typically in those nations people are poor and don&#39;t over consume, or they die young and therefore do not create the same level of problems that Americans tend to.</p>

<p>Many American families have not just one car.. but two, and in some cases more.  Contrasting to people in many parts of the world where the people ride bikes most of the time.</p>

<p>Americans love holidays - cruises, and so forth.. all bad.</p>

Every year, the world sees new levels that were previously unrecorded in modern human history.</a></p>

<p>Let that sink in. We haven&#39;t reversed CO2 levels. We haven&#39;t slowed CO2 production. We haven&#39;t levelled out CO2 production. We haven&#39;t even gotten to an even rate of increase. We haven&#39;t slowed down the <em>acceleration</em> of CO2 production.</p>

<p>Global warming isn&#39;t a what if.** It&#39;s going to happen.** Nothing short of a global nuclear war wiping out 99% of humanity will stop it.</p>

<p>So the question to be asked should really be, is all the effort to tax CO2 emissions from our electricity generation to our cars to our businesses the right thing to do? The direct result is irreversible damage to free economies. We are handing asshole countries like China, with no regulation free reign to undercut and destroy our core industries. Not only are they producing more CO2, they are producing incredible pollution hat are destroying the environment.</p>

<p>The EU led a massive push to move to diesel vehicles because they are more efficient and produce less CO2. Problem is we&#39;ve no heavily polluted our cities, our air and destroyed the health of our people. Yet we moved that way to try to minimise CO2 ... which hasn&#39;t worked.</p>

<p>We&#39;ve already caused irreversible damage to our core industries, (steel, manufacturing etc) and yet ... no results. <em>Is that worth it?</em></p>

<p>Or should we actually be utilising the cheap, easy energy production of fossil fuels to get us ready for the new world? Strengthen our economies. Make industry cheaper to run. Make products easier to build. Make the world ready for the end of Earths ice age.</p>

t3_2yxw0j	"CMV: Besides combating climate change, I believe the development of technologies and research to understand the brain (and the accompanying governmental investment) is presently the most important task humankind can undertake."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>To be frank, I consider MRIs pretty unimpressive and don&#39;t think they can tell us much about the brain and, for that matter, neither can any other current technology. We don&#39;t even know how many neurotransmitters there are and <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/2x9cs5/how_specifically_are_neurotransmitters_studied/?sort=confidence"">have no effective way of studying them.</a> There are, however, some very promising theories/methods of studying the brain. If successful, these projects will show us how different activities/inputs/treatments actually change the brain and how that applies to one&#39;s psychology (and ideally putting us in a constant state of bliss, obviously. Yay!!), which is particularly vital for <a href=""http://psychcentral.com/blog/archives/2011/09/03/cdc-statistics-mental-illness-in-the-us/"">every second person,</a> who will suffer from a mental disorder in their lifetime.</p>

<p>These theories include:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href=""https://youtube.com/watch?v=HA7GwKXfJB0"">The Connectome</a>(which I recommend everybody check out.)
Basically once we improve visual machine learning enough (easy to say, I know), we could trace a map of the brain, albeit dead, relatively fast. Note that Sebastian&#39;s speech is from 2010, so we&#39;ve progressed a bit since then. These maps are weighted, meaning they <em>will</em> take into account the <em>strength</em> synapse used.</p></li>
<li><p><a href=""http://m.caltech.edu/content/sensing-neuronal-activity-light"">Optogenetics:</a> changing neuronal genetics allowing areas of the brain to be studied through the application of light.</p></li>
<li><p>Etc.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Check this list of projects the US is investing in: <a href=""http://www.braininitiative.nih.gov/nih-brain-awards.htm#RFA-14-215"">BRAIN Initiative</a></p>

<p>I am going to compare the EU and US brain and space programs for argument&#39;s sake. The BRAIN initiative receives a paltry 1.7% the amount of funding compared to NASA. The Human Brain Project also only receives about 2% what the ESA gets.</p>

<p>I do not believe that space exploration (SE from here on out) programs will achieve as significant tangible results for people in the near future as studying the brain (as complex and agonizing it may be). This in no way dismisses the importance of NASA/ESA, and I definitely do not think their funding should be cut. If anything money should be reallocated from the defense budget (or drug war, etc. But that&#39;s a different topic) to support the space agencies since their projects have an impact on planning national security. </p>

<p>Also, SE is important to find life elsewhere, find a plan b planet, and prevent potential meteors and asteroids from hitting us. Obviously an asteroid would be devastating, but alas, this will not be a short term project. Protection from meteors is important and should probably be well funded. I would argue the first two are not as important in the short term, and they, too, are not likely in the short term. Nonetheless, progress in those areas should obviously not be neglected. As for NASA being responsible for a ridiculous amount of important everyday inventions, that is clearly great, but I believe at this point still secondary to brain research. </p>

<p>I think the biggest issue currently with my argument is the details of the best areas in brain research to invest are a little foggy. Fear not though, since I do have some ideas. Firstly, public awareness for citizen science programs like Eyewire (a game where you can trace neurons, which improves the algorithm in the process) should be raised and introduced to schools, there should be a targeted effort to get the IT industry to focus on improving visual AI to accelerate the goal of full automation. And there should be more investment to increase the manpower going into the field of neuroscience to accelerate all other programs that will lead to a comprehensive understanding of the brain.</p>

<p>So in conclusion, brain research=important/should be more heavily funded.</p>

t3_dj086n	CMV: The best way an individual can realistically have an impact on global warming is to change the way they eat.

There are several of these, and none are exactly the same, but the relative sizes are generally consistent. we&#39;ll be working off this. </p>

<p>We&#39;re going to approach this from a &quot;low hanging fruit&quot; perspective. While the full scope of the issue should be addressed, the individual is best suited to attack areas where the cost is minimal and the return is meaningful. </p>

<p>Premise: The way we eat, and more specifically, the way we source our food, is the best way an individual can help reduce GGE. </p>

<p>The arguments as to why the non-agriculture categories are more difficult for individuals to impact: </p>

<ol>
<li>Transportation: 

<ol>
<li>For most people who drive cars, it is not really a simple thing to go buy a new hybrid or electric car. For most people, a car is a pretty expensive purchase, and a lot of people who drive couldn&#39;t afford a new car. </li>
<li>For people who don&#39;t live in cities, or live in the suburbs and commute into cities, public transportation is not  always an option. There is likely a group of people who drive b/c the want to even though they could take public transportation, but if they haven&#39;t made the change already, i can&#39;t see why they would now. </li>

<li>The individual has little control over how power is produced. I don&#39;t know for sure, but i don&#39;t think many places offer a &quot;green&quot; and &quot;non-green&quot; energy option. So, even if you reduce your own electrical use in your house, the net gain is minimal. </li>
<li>Going off the grid w/ things like solar panels is an interesting option, but is most likely cost-prohibitive for most people. I got quotes from SolarCity, it was something like 60k for my house. I don&#39;t have that sort of money available, even if i know the long-term benefits. </li>
<li>The average individual has little impact on industrial and commercial use. However, we&#39;ll come back to this one again later as well. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Industry

<ol>
<li>We&#39;ll come back to this. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Commercial and residential: 

<ol>
<li>The &quot;commercial&quot; here refers to office buildings, shopping malls, and the like. Residential refers to home heating fuels. By definition, the individual can&#39;t do much around how commercial buildings are built, and many businesses are building zero-footprint buildings. </li>
<li>Within your residence, an individual could buy a wood furnace and burn firewood instead of oil, propane, or natural gas. Again though, changing over your heating system in a house is a rather expensive thing that most people probably can&#39;t afford easily, and i&#39;m not sure what sort of net gain we&#39;d see if everyone burned firewood. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>summary of the non-ag categories: also, there is one big aspect that makes these very difficult. meaningful impact will require legislation. while individuals can impact legislation, it is hard, slow, and not a certainty. </li>
<li>Agriculture</li>
</ol>

<p>This one is where i think we can really make a difference. Agriculture sits at the bottom of many, many production lines. </p>

<ol>
<li>To begin with, agriculture feeds us. To feed us at scale, we have developed wildly efficient, but wildly unhealthy, production operations. B/c the operations are so unnatural, they rely heavily on:

<ol>
<li> chemical fertilizers. These fertilizers have to be produced by industry (see above where i said we&#39;d come back to some of these).Many of these fertilizers rely on fossil fuels in their production. To produce them, we have to move material all around in trucks over highways.<br/></li>
<li>Irrigation. irrigation diverts natural waterways away from ecosystems where we&#39;d see GGE sinks. irrigation, when using fertilizer, creates toxic runoffs that damage natural ecosystems where we see GGE sinks. </li>
<li>genetically engineered plants and animals. i don&#39;t want to the the convo if GMO foods are bad for us as individuals, but at scale, the modification of plants and animals to fit into the unnatural agricultural processes we use today expose us to new diseases and pests (which we will talk about next). In addition, the demand for unnaturally efficient plants and animals reduces the &quot;hybrid vigor&quot; of more natural domesticated animals. </li>
<li>pesticides: while we modify plants to be resistant to pests, pests are still a problem in industrial farming. Natural plants, growing naturally, have evolved to cope with pests over millions of years and have, for the most part, established a working relationship with them. the pests eat a little bit, but the overall plant survives. these pesticides kill beneficial insects like honeybees, a key pollinator species. W/o pollinators, wild plants struggle to create future generations, thus reducing potential GGE sinks. pesticides, like fertilizers, also create GGE through their production, meaning they drive up transportation and industrial GGE as well. </li>
<li>large amounts of animals. and these animals need to eat a lot. and to feed them, we have to convert otherwise natural ecosystems into farming systems, where, we grow genetically modified crops to feed them (and perpetuate our cycle). b/c large amounts of animals are eating large amounts of food, they poop a lot. and we have to dispose to this. in a natural ecosystem, the land that sustains animals benefits from the the animals poop. but, industrial agriculture is generating animal waste at scales well beyond the needs of the soil. it becomes poisonous sludge that kills water and top soil systems. </li>
<li>land alteration. to farm efficiently, we need efficient land plots. this alteration stresses the natural topsoil generation and eventually depletes the system to a point where it can no longer &quot;digest&quot; organic material and replenish itself. This land then requires constant fertilization, furthering our cycle. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>Agriculture doesn&#39;t just generate food, but it generates large amounts of base materials used in all sorts of other industrial production. Some of this is &quot;waste&quot; product from the food generation, some of it is non-waste. Either way, this production line generates GGE in the production of plastics (which end up in ocean), fuel (emissions), fertilizer (for industrial agriculture), corn syrup (in most processed foods, but also used in consumer goods), and many other chemicals or products. Each product needs to move this stuff around, so we impact the transportation bucket as well. </li>
</ol>

<p>Now, why is agriculture the best way for an individual to reduce the overall carbon footprint? b/c the vast majority of this agricultural food production is based on the demand of <a href=""https://www.beefmagazine.com/mag/beef_big_beef_buyers"">fast food chains and supermarkets</a>. While a new electric car, or solar roofing, or public transportation might all be too expensive or impractical for most people, not eating at mcdonalds (or the like) is something that if not most, then certainly a lot, of us can do. even better, if some of us can source our meat and produce from local farmers, we reduce the entire chain of GGE that we see in starting w/ the agricultural process. if we can drive down the demand that the fast food market, then those farmers building their entire business around enormous amounts of food at unnaturally low costs can change the way they produce. </p>

<p>i know that there are people who can&#39;t afford to change the way they eat, but many, many of us can. and while it is not the entire answer GGE, it is the best way the individual can do something immediately that will actually have an impact. </p>

<p>to change my view: </p>

<ol>
<li>we might differ on whether or not climate change is real, we might differ on whether or not its man made, we might differ on whether or not its bad. these are not the point. you disagree w/ me on all those points, and i could still be right that the best way for an individual to reduce GGE is by the way we eat. that would just mean you think its not important. </li>
<li>you could show me realistic ways individuals can change the other categories. 

<ol>
<li>for purposes of the argument, its important that realistic incorporate real life considerations. what is practical should be generalizable, b/c we need to achieve scale. </li>
<li>It must be reasonably affordable for the average person. </li>
<li>it must be something that would impact most everyone. </li>
<li>it can&#39;t be so drastic that it ruins the quality of people&#39;s lives. we need to drive adoption. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>you could show me that i&#39;m wrong about the impact of industrial agriculture 

<ol>
<li>i would be most interested to hear these arguments. </li>
</ol></li>
<li>you could show me that the alternative solution is unrealistic. 

<ol>
<li>wherein, the alternative is: people stop eating fast food, and, if / when possible, people source their food locally from small farmers.</li>
</ol></li>

t3_8i9wzg	"CMV: Pro-environment concerns should stop using the words ""climate change"" and focus on clean air and water"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First of all I&#39;ll establish that I am not a climate change denier. But there are plenty of otherwise reasonable people who deny it - the fact that they are otherwise reasonable actually makes it more frustrating since you can&#39;t simply dismiss them as &quot;nutcases who follow Alex Jones&quot;. </p>

<p>Whenever anyone mentions climate change, deniers immediately trot out points like &quot;the temperatures dropped at this time&quot; or &quot;weather patterns change inevitably, it&#39;s just nature&quot; or whatever. At the more extreme end of the spectrum, deniers will claim it&#39;s some conspiracy to destroy manufacturing and enrich foreign countries. And these deniers have significant numbers - and with those numbers, the power to disrupt efforts to combat climate change (at least in the US).</p>

<p>On the other hand, the importance of keeping the air and water clean is a point that seems to be MUCH easier to get across to people of all political leanings. Very few people would deny that emissions are the reason why Beijing and New Delhi have such horrible air quality, for example. Very few people dare to drink water that has untreated waste dumped inside, or eat fish that was caught in grossly polluted waters. There is also undeniable historical data that shows a clear correlation between the cleanliness of the air in Los Angeles and the strictness of California emissions standards. A few decades ago, Los Angeles&#39; smog was as bad as Beijing&#39;s is now, if not worse - but today, the situation is measurably much better. Even Beijing has shown clear improvements in air quality thanks to extreme measures like restricting the number of cars in the city on certain days of the week. </p>

<p>Therefore, anyone who wants to preserve environmental regulations, or introduce new ones, needs to make clean air and water the central point, and not mention climate change even once. The answer to the question &quot;Do you want our cities to have the same air quality as Beijing or New Delhi&quot; should be a unanimous &quot;NO&quot;. Emphasize the fact that breathable air and drinkable water are only possible because of these regulations. Fly some of these people (if they&#39;re in positions of power) to third world countries to &quot;sample&quot; the air and water and prove the point. That may be the only way to bring at least a few climate change deniers on board.</p>

I&#39;m not saying other things don&#39;t contribute to the problem, but factory farming contributes almost more than any other industries.</p>

<p>As an individual, the biggest change reducing global warming and water consumption you can make is by quitting eating meat, therefore reducing demand.</p>

<p><a href=""http://water.org/water-crisis/water-sanitation-facts/"">Yes, water scarcity is a problem.</a></p>

<p><a href=""http://waterfootprint.org/en/water-footprint/personal-water-footprint/"">&quot;For example, the water footprint of 200 grammes of beef is the equivalent to 47 eight-minute showers.&quot;</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_impact_of_meat_production"">&quot;Globally, enteric fermentation (mostly in ruminant livestock) accounts for about 27 percent of anthropogenic methane emissions, and methane accounts for about 32 to 40 percent of agriculture’s greenhouse gas emissions (estimated as 100-year carbon dioxide equivalents) as tabulated by the IPCC. Methane has a global warming potential recently estimated as 35 times that of an equivalent mass of carbon dioxide.&quot;</a></p>

<p>As for CO2: &quot;A previous, widely cited FAO report using somewhat more comprehensive analysis had estimated 18 percent.&quot;</p>

<p>Quitting meat consumption has a much bigger impact compared to driving a more fuel efficient car or limiting gas to help reduce global warming.</p>

<p>As for water scarcity, limiting showers also has a much lesser impact compared to quitting meat.</p>

t3_e4cukq	CMV: Socialism in it and of itself won't be an effective solution to climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This is something that&#39;s always been on my mind for some time. There seem to be a lot more calls nowadays for a switch from neoliberal capitalism to socialism, as a means of combatting the current climate crisis we have. However, the question I have is that how  is socialism supposed to combat climate change?</p>

<p>I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s not going to be a form of dictatorship socialism, and that it will be democratic and hopefully a form of grassroots democracy, as each community/local representatives vote for their higher-ups until it goes all the way to the federal level.</p>

<p>So the question I&#39;m having, is why is it assumed that switching to that form of governance/economic system would make our problems disappear given that half the nation constantly votes against climate action policy? Wouldn&#39;t they just vote for candidates that deny climate change to be an emergency and would more or less just support fossil fuel industries out of a feeling for stability and familiarity?</p>

t3_beprc2	"CMV: A tax on imported goods is a good way to boost local economy, bring the jobs back from them asians, fight climate change, and all without screwing over the poor (more than they already are)."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m going to place my arguments for all four parts of my statement separately, with a brief introduction, even though consequencues 1, 2 and 3 are really interconnected</p>

<h1><strong>Introduction: The Proposal</strong></h1>

<p>I&#39;m proposing a plan consisting of three parts. A tax on imported goods, have it announced a year before it&#39;s implemented (or however long it takes to set up production. Let the economists figure that out) and have government loans given to set up the infrastructure to produce locally</p>

<h1><strong>Expected Consequences</strong></h1>

<p><strong>Boosting Local Economy</strong></p>

<p>With the government loans and a time conscious announcement, many entrepreneurs could have an easy time setting up production for the goods which are planned to be taxed, with the certainty that the tax will make it an easy competition, and also time it properly so they can fill the gap for the cheap local alternatives to the imported goods ASAP. More local businesses means more money flowing around the country, never crossing borders. So less foreign money sinkholes.</p>

<p><strong>Bringing the jobs back</strong></p>

<p>All these new local industries and production lines are going to need a workforce. I realise that this point gets pretty weak when taking into account automation, but  if they are robots, they are our robots doing the work. It brings the jobs back, but doesn&#39;t bring it to the people. But that topic is for another discussion</p>

<p><strong>Not screwing over the poor</strong></p>

<p>After local businesses take over the production of everyday necessities, imported goods become luxury items for people looking for that foreign experience. People who are willing to pay extra for the foreign experience are not poor in my book. Probably local production and the tax on improved goods would all come together to make prices higher overall, but a new high demand for workers and the new stronger economy could potentially level things out. And if those jobs are automated, well, that&#39;s another discussion.</p>

<p><strong>Fighting climate change</strong></p>

<p>Local production means less transportation needed. The gigantic cargo ships coming from and to China are big polluters, and taking production back into our borders eliminates the need for so many of them doing so many trips</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>A tax on imported goods is a fantastic way to boost local economy, bring the jobs back from them asians, fight climate change, and all without screwing over the poor (more than they already are).</p>

<p>CMV</p>

<p><strong>Foot note</strong></p>

<p>I didn&#39;t discuss what to do with the tax money or the loan pay-back because it is a safety net for the local government to throw money at any and all the problems that might arise with this plan. But when in doubt, I think it would be best used to improve public infrastructure, which benefits the poor the most. And an educated, well round populous is the best for the economy, and the people themselves.</p>

<p>I also didn&#39;t discuss what I mean with local. I think for the US border (because I didn&#39;t even specifies a country, but I wrote it with the US in mind) is in the limit of the biggest local could be, and state the smallest. </p>

<p>For non-US countries I think the plan also holds true, when they have the economical strength to implement it, and the material capabilities to produce. The Vatican for example is a really bad candidate for this plan.</p>

<h1><strong>Delta awarding</strong></h1>

<p>If I have new light shed in any of the 4 main issues (that doesn&#39;t align with my arguments, and can&#39;t be negated with the tax money and the loans payback) I will award a Delta. E.g.: if in some way it slows the local Economy I would award a delta. If it helps the poor in a way I haven&#39;t listed I can&#39;t assure that I will award one, but I might if it changes my view significantly. Same thing with tax money and loan payback usage.</p>

<p>If I&#39;m convinced of large consequence I haven&#39;t foreseen I will award a delta</p>

t3_41myv3	CMV: There are no Moral Implications to Climate Change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><blockquote>
<p>There are no moral implications to climate change</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, I feel like this might be a bit of a stupid one but I want to see how this is responded to.</p>

<p>I want to start by clarifying exactly what I mean when I say moral implications and climate change before the argument really starts. So, by moral implications I of course mean that our causing climate change is neither a good nor a bad thing. Climate change is simply a result of what we as humans have collectively done for our energy. Anything that results from our choices for energy has no moral bearing on anything. And by climate change I am of course referring to climate change originating from human consumption. For the purpose of this argument we&#39;re assuming the majority of observable climate change today originates from humans (if that even has to be stated).</p>

<p>Alright, now, for my justifications. So, climate change has happened on Earth for a pretty huge variety of reasons over a pretty huge period of time. Some from semi-random geological/meteorological events. Others from semi-random biological events - namely bacteria that produced oxygen. Then at some point one that consumed oxygen. If any of this is inaccurate feel free to point it out, but don&#39;t expect that in and of itself to change my opinion.</p>

<p>The heart of my argument I believe lies in &quot;semi-random biological processes.&quot; Not only is the existence of an intelligent species semi-random, so is the existence of oil. The fact that we happened to come to being and happened to find and use oil to power our world is no less a coincidence than any bacterial species or volcanoes or meteors capable of causing climate change. This coincidence is no more morally bad than the bacteria. Just as we don&#39;t think the bacteria is morally bad for accidentally killing itself and countless other species we honestly shouldn&#39;t find ourselves morally bad for the climate change we see today.</p>

<p>Convince me I&#39;m wrong by:</p>

<p>-Showing evidence I&#39;m straight up wrong about any past climate change (don&#39;t find this likely, but give it a shot)</p>

<p>-Making a convincing argument that there are moral implications to climate change and its effects (beyond &quot;it&#39;s death and all death is morally bad)</p>

<p>-Making a convincing argument that there is a difference in moral judgement between intelligent life and non-intelligent life (referring to the bacteria)</p>

<p>I hope for some meaningful discussion here and I really hope that my argument here isn&#39;t a complete mess :)</p>

t3_4or9cr	"CMV: Due to Climate Change and the growing world population, the most moral option in the US is to adopt instead of having a biological child."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First I just want to say, I do not want this to turn into a <a href=""/r/childfree"">/r/childfree</a> extravaganza. My views on having children aren&#39;t what I want changed.</p>

<p>My perspective is that with the problems facing the world, bringing a new child into it is reckless. Climate Change is worsening while the world is doing relatively little to combat it. I think combined problems of Climate Change and growing world populations will lead to increased water scarcity and food shortages.</p>

<p>If those things are true, the only moral option for a person (or couple) wanting children is to adopt, instead of giving birth to their own children and adding to the problem. </p>

<p>Edit: I think my word choice of &quot;moral&quot; may have skewed my argument in a direction I didn&#39;t intend. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s &quot;immoral&quot; to have biological children, which would mean it isn&#39;t &quot;moral&quot; to adopt. A better word choice would have likely been &quot;responsible&quot; or &quot;prudent&quot; since I think it is just a better idea from the perspective of societal/cultural problems to slow the growth of our population. </p>

t3_egpk28	"CMV: Climate change is real, but there is uncertainty if it's going to endanger human lives"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve tried asking and finding facts about the effect of a rise of temperature and heatwaves on human lives, to see if it&#39;s really so serious.</p>

<p>It&#39;s true that there are many effects, like on oceans, biodiversity, forest fires, etc, all are worrying and problematic.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, when thinking about putting pressure on politicians to reduce GHG emissions, it&#39;s necessary to find arguments that can affect a consumer and effectively deteriorate one&#39;s living standard (water and food supply, health, etc). Consumers will (sadly) not change their way of life if it doesn&#39;t endanger their future. Consumers don&#39;t really care about the environment, unless they can enjoy its fruits, which are essentially consumer products.</p>

<p>I wish I could have arguments and sources to tell people that if they do nothing, they&#39;re going to suffer or die in the future, but so far, even if climate change is real, it doesn&#39;t really matter: people will still be able to eat meat, use their car, buy whatever they want even if it ruins the environment.</p>

<p>Of course there can be arguments of armed conflict, caused by drought and food crisis, but those problem are only local and usually contained (Syria, in part, is one example).</p>

<p>TLDR: climate change doesn&#39;t endanger human lives</p>

<p>PS: I&#39;m posting this here to give the benefit of the doubt. I want to believe climate change pose a great risk of human lives because it really looks like it is a possible risk, but so far, the risk is not proven.</p>

<p>As always, I&#39;m being a little disappointed to see this post being downvoted. Sometimes I realize I should ask a question the other way. I should have posted &quot;CMV: climate change is going to kill 90% of the population because of drought and a food crisis&quot;</p>

I don’t believe there is but let’s take for granted that there is. I’m saying that there’s no reason not to resolve it. After talking to many of my family who are climate deniers and working backwards the argument seems to boil down to “the left wants to solve climate change so I oppose that” let’s take for granted that climate change isn’t caused by humans or isn’t real at all and then continue to ask “why not take the steps necessary to solve it?” The worst case scenario from where I stand is that the conservatives are right, climate change isn’t real and the air is cleaner and we aren’t going to run out of fuel before the next century. I don’t see a reason not to. The other arguments seem to be “it seems hard” which isn’t really a reason and “it’ll trash the economy” which is being debunked by the nations who are taking steps and not seeing this happen to their economy. </p>

Having access to fresh water will never be an issue, maybe merely an inconvenience with possibly higher prices for all sorts of resources. I don&#39;t think I would ever visit the poles in my lifetime. Species going extinct doesn&#39;t affect humans, mainly just other animals, and if there was a chain reaction throughout the whole chain, humans have enough ingenuity for other sources of food.

t3_ay1m7z	CMV: Reducing carbon emissions to address climate change is a waste of resources	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>For the last 10 years or so I&#39;ve been reading with increasing frequency statements from climatologists that amount to an admission that time&#39;s up for halting catastrophic climate change (CCC) through reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.  As just one example, see <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/y27g5pn3"">this</a> IPCC chart from last October (full report <a href=""https://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf"">here</a>).  Of course, there are plenty of people who believe we still have x years to halt it, and I&#39;m not here to have a debate over who&#39;s right.  </p>

<p>My question is, if you&#39;re in the first camp, what&#39;s the point of spending even a dollar to reduce emissions instead of spending that dollar on adaptation?  I realize that reducing emissions may reduce the severity, and/or delay the start, of CCC, but it seems to me the relationship between the amount and rate of reduction and those benefits is highly speculative; we&#39;re still going to get hammered, regardless.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, there are things we know we can start doing today to help civilization survive and thrive in a warmer world (build sea walls around coastal cities, develop temperature resistant crops, research cures for tropical diseases, etc.).  Even if you&#39;re convinced we should still be spending something on reduction, isn&#39;t the resource allocation lopsided?  I don&#39;t follow the climate change discussion very closely, but it seems like 99.9% of the money (and conversation) is about reduction and not about adaptation.</p>

t3_2631ft	CMV: I don't think that the 97%ish of climate scientists who feel that climate change is largely man-caused are lying to get their precious grant money like conservatives often claim.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>That is often a significant argument from climate change-deniers trying to explain the beyond overwhelming scientific consensus regarding man-caused climate change. I feel like this is absurd. I believe that most climate scientists spending substantial time working are not lying and falsifying date so they can get grant money to falsify more data about climate change. I believe they are more interested in putting their years of education to proper use then intentionally lying to the rest of world. Change my view!</p>

t3_f4gi9s	CMV: I don’t totally trust the 97% Climate Change Consensus	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>4,000 scientific papers were accepted and of them, 97% either agreed: Climate change is mainly manmade. </p>

<p>That means 3%, 120 people, still disagree with the consensus. But why? What were there experiments? What did they do differently? Were they not climatologists? Were they funded by different people?</p>

<p>This is why I hate people using the climate consensus: it’s a shorthand argument for experiments they don’t completely understand. </p>

<p>If we go only by Consensus, we’ll run into the same trouble Coke did in the 1980s (they believed Pepsi’s consensus that Pepsi was better, ignoring the experiment was done in Dixie cups, and changed their formula to something suitable to Dixie cups, which people hated); as well as the same problem Eugenicists created in the early 20th century (which many people believed at the time). Consensus alone will hurt companies and possibly hurt a lot of people. </p>

<p>I understand the survey was redone several times by other companies, but why do the minority disagree? I need to know all the facts, bias-free. Google tells me nothing and Google scholar provides no direct answers. Please help me understand. Change my view if possible.</p>

<p>Edit: View changed. I really appreciate everyone who sent articles on all the research done. I conclude, until I experiment on climate science for myself, or see new evidence come to light from others, I should default to the current opinion that climate change is manmade. My issue was not with the idea that humans can drastically change their environment; instead, it was with the discussion at hand. I’m a bit of a lawyer at heart, so I like to scrutinize evidence, and I understand any jury can act irrationally. 
Again, thank you for everyone who discussed this. My view will progressively change as I read the articles sent my way.</p>

t3_845f2r	"CMV: The battle against climate change is largerly lost, any western individual's attempt at reducing the personal carbon footprint is quixotic and useless."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This comes from someone who has given up meat to do his part part in ameliorating climate change - but I could not muster the willpower for full on veganism.</p>

<p>And I feel that this is symptomatic: The level of &quot;necessities&quot; I am willing to give up is nowhere near large enough in magnitude to stop climate change - likely not even, if it was &quot;up-scaled&quot;, with everyone behaving the same way. At the same time, that level for others is not giving up their car (which I don&#39;t have anyway - on of the blessings of urban europe)  or not giving up going on holiday by plane.</p>

<p>At the same time as many Westerners grudgingly start acknowledging that their (more honestly: our) lifestyle might be a problem, people in developing countries long for the lifestyle the West has afforded so far with little to no thought of sustainabilty - and cannot really be reproached for that by someone like me (at least not without hypocrisy).</p>

<p>And that is just individual consumer behaviour - there is also the industry.</p>

<p>I feel that the only way something might still be done about climate change would be large scale political action around the globe, a large scale shift to nuclear energy (and at some point, nuclear fusion) and/or a politically mandated and enforced steep increase on the price of fossile fuels.</p>

<p>I can see none of that coming in the foreseeable future, so my conclusion is:
I might as well give up on my vegeterianism, fly to the maledives while they are there and invest in a stock market portfolio that will profit off climate change.</p>

<p>For the love of all that is yet good and innocent within me: Change my view.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_6ggki4	CMV: I think that states tackling the issue of climate change head on can be better and more effective than the federal government	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Before I start out I just want to state that I am a very conservative person, but to me one of the most important issues is tackling climate change. It is a problem that isn&#39;t going to go away as long as people inhabit the earth and well beyond our time is over on earth our actions will affect earth so I believe that we should be working together to reduce the human effects of climate change on earth. 
Without debating the U.S. pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement I think that states can do a much more effective job at curtailing the effects of climate change by people with actions states have the ability to control better than the federal government.</p>

<p>*Education states control their own school system curriculum why not include classes or topics on the environment. Personally in middle and high school I did not really receive much education on climate change, I even remember one earth science teacher I had say that he looked at the numbers and he didn&#39;t think that global warming was such a big issue. Granted I was in ninth grade at the time but I&#39;m sure that had an impact on the young minds in the room at the time because it sure did for me thinking that climate change wasn&#39;t important until I got to college and realized exactly the opposite. Educating young minds about climate change is the first step in getting the population to realize that this is an issue and a long term plan that states can enact. Then states can focus on putting educational emphasis in science and math courses to try and mold scientists and people who can push who forward and hopefully make the U.S. a leader in green technology. </p>

<p>*State land management and the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) giving state agencies a role in carrying out the vision is important in my opinion because they can help be the hand that carries it out on public land and utilizing public resources along with being experts on the land and resources the state has and what policies would work best. For example in Minnesota there was just an article in the Star Tribune (sorry couldn&#39;t find the article) about how the DNR is expanding their planting of specific trees to try and combat climate change and helping to manage wildlife during climate change. </p>

<p>*Farming and industrial practices. Let me start out by saying that I live in Minnesota where farming is very big and iron product is also big. Here is a picture of Virginia, Minnesota and a <a href=""http://www.twincities.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/20140703__MNDOT_mine_bridge_ironrange.jpg"">lake</a>, heads up that isn&#39;t a lake its an old open surface mine that is filled with water. While we can&#39;t go back and change prior practices of how we obtained resources we needed we can change requirements that states impose to make mining more <a href=""http://www.miningfacts.org/Environment/How-can-mining-become-more-environmentally-sustainable/"">environmentally friendly</a> because at the end of the day we still need those resouces. Farming practices in Minnesota contribute the the dead zone in the <a href=""https://serc.carleton.edu/microbelife/topics/deadzone/index.html"">Gulf of Mexico</a> now again we need to eat but can states require less use of nitrates and phosphates that contribute to the dead zone. Perhaps instituting a system similar to carbon credits for nitrates and phosphates could be an acceptable start which could lead to trying to eliminating the contamination altogether. </p>

<p>*Alternative fuels. Could encouraging alternative fuels such as natural gas instead of other fossil fuels at energy plants and in cars (if they are equiped to do so) be a gap fuel until we can rely off of renewables more. From the article I am <a href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-energy/coal-and-other-fossil-fuels/environmental-impacts-of-natural-gas#.WTwpKdLyuM8"">sourcing</a> </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Natural gas emits 50 to 60 percent less carbon dioxide (CO2) when combusted in a new, efficient natural gas power plant compared with emissions from a typical new coal plant [1]. Considering only tailpipe emissions, natural gas also emits 15 to 20 percent less heat-trapping gases than gasoline when burned in today’s typical vehicle [2].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To me that is a pretty attractive alternative if a plant is equipped to do so as the article talks about.</p>

<p>*Landfills, recycling and incineration plants. Trying to reduce the amount of garbage that goes into the ground should be a priority and making sure that everything that can be recycled or reused should be. We should also look into using our garbage as a fuel source such as bio fuel <a href=""http://www.startribune.com/first-garbage-to-ethanol-plant-in-u-s-proposed-for-inver-grove-heights/418773374/"">one has been proposed in Minnesota</a> rather than just sending garbage into a landfill or blindly into an incinerator.</p>

<p>*Vehicle inspections/emission tests.  Right now 33/50 states have required vehicle emiision testing on either the state, county/parish or city level along with the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. <a href=""http://drivinglaws.aaa.com/tag/emissions-inspection/"">According to AAA</a> Vehicle emissions tests serve a good purpose but they are not standard among states as I included states that at any level have vehicle emissions tests and they probably widely vary at what levels they are looking for and probably easy to bypass. If states each adopt a standard that they deem acceptable it would be a good starting point to get inefficient vehicles either off the road or impose a higher tax to drive the vehicle that goes to fund green initiatives. </p>

<p>*Tax credits, deductions and grants for supporting green initiatives such as new and used hybrid vehicles, solar panels, geothermal systems, etc for private and business use. I do know that each state does have limited funds to combat climate change and if they choose to use those funds by extending or expanding tax credits, deductions and grants could incentivize users to go the green route. From personal experience I used to work at a public ice facility that got a federal and state loan to install a geothermal system to heat and cool our building and water systems which saves the facility a lot of money by not having to pay for the heating and cooling costs. Now in my mind having these grants make sense for high users of resources. Along with having tax credits and deductions for other green tech I think they need to be eventually phased down but for the time being keep them at the levels they are at so people will take advantage of them. </p>

<p>Let me know what you think change my view on why it would be better for the federal government to tackle the issue instead of states. Sorry for any misspellings or grammar mistakes. </p>

<p>You get the idea.</p>

<p>I would also like to point out that some people replying to those quotes DO support my point, so do not assume all Trump supporters do not believe in climate change.

<p>I am going to preface this by saying I am not a scientist. Do not take me completely at my word, and reading my sources will definitely provide a better outline of the issue than I ever could. However, I will be citing scientists who have studied this their entire lives.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>NATURAL EFFECTS ON CLIMATE</strong></p>

<p>There are many reasons the climate can change. We&#39;ve seen it happen numerous times throughout Earth&#39;s history. It is well known that <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/srep09957"">ocean-atmosphere variability</a> has the ability to spontaneously change climates that can persist for decades at a time. We see this with El Niño, among other oscillations in persistent weather patterns. Many postulate that these variations play a huge role in the heating of Earth&#39;s oceans, which can have <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Ice_Age"">substantial effects for centuries at a time</a>. </p>

<p>Other natural effects on climate include life (such as the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_cycle"">carbon cycle</a>, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Water_cycle"">water cycle</a>, and more). Glaciation periods substantially affect the Earth&#39;s climate.</p>

<p>Outside of Earth, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milankovitch_cycles"">Earth&#39;s orbit</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_cycle"">solar output</a> can have drastic effects on climate that can last very long periods of time.</p>

<p>Obviously there are more things that impact climate but I just wanted to touch on some of the big ones.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>CURRENT HEATING PERIOD</strong></p>

<p>Our primary method for evaluating current climate change is indirect, because we cannot simply go back in time with a thermometer and measure Earth&#39;s temperature. We use <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glaciology"">glacial geology</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegetation"">history of plant life</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_core"">ice cores</a>, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dendrochronology"">tree dating</a>, and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sea_level_rise"">sea level variation</a> to get a good figure on what the climate looked like at a certain period. Since the mid-20th century, we HAVE had <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiosonde"">thermometers and balloons</a> which helps us create a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_temperature_record"">record of global temperatures</a>.</p>

<p><strong>ALL OF THESE INDICATORS POINT TO A HEATING PERIOD.</strong> The decline in arctic sea ice, abrupt global vegetation disruption, increasing extinction rates, sea level change, and huge measurable temperature increases all point to a period of global warming.</p>

<p>Some truly horrifying, and specific, effects that are happening as a result of this climate change today: the slowing down, and possible shutdown of the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermohaline_circulation"">global thermohaline ocean current</a>; unprecedented carbon and methane release from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arctic_methane_emissions"">melting permafrost</a> that may be unstoppable at this point; the possibility of exponentially <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-glacial_rebound"">increasing volcanic activity</a> as a result of receding glaciers impacting geology; <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_acidification"">increasing ocean acidification</a>, threatening the majority of life on Earth; and the existence of our <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction"">very own major extinction period that is due to human activity</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>HUMAN INFLUENCE</strong></p>

<p>To start, <strong>not a single national science academy disputes or denies the scientific consensus around human-caused climate change.</strong></p>

<p>Virtually all credible scientific institutions have concluded that human activity has most likely caused most of the <a href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/human-contribution-to-gw-faq.html"">&quot;observed increase in globally averaged temperatures since the mid-20th century&quot;</a>. I will provide show some examples to illustrate the point:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC): <a href=""http://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/AR5_SYR_FINAL_SPM.pdf"">&quot;Human influence on the climate system is clear, and recent anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse
gases are the highest in history.&quot;</a></p></li>
<li><p>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA): <a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/"">&quot;The current warming trend is of particular significance because most of it is extremely likely (greater than 95 percent probability) to be the result of human activity since the mid-20th century and proceeding at a rate that is unprecedented over decades to millennia&quot;.</a></p></li>
<li><p>The American Meteorological Society (AMS): <a href=""https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/about-ams/ams-statements/statements-of-the-ams-in-force/climate-change/"">&quot;It is clear from extensive scientific evidence that the dominant cause of the rapid change in climate of the past half century is human-induced increases in the amount of atmospheric greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and nitrous oxide&quot;.</a></p></li>
<li><p>The World Health Organization: <a href=""http://www.who.int/features/factfiles/climate_change/en/"">&quot;Overwhelming evidence shows that human activities are affecting the global climate&quot;.</a></p></li>
<li><p>The American Meteorological Society: <a href=""http://www.ucsusa.org/global_warming/science_and_impacts/science/scientific-consensus-on.html"">&quot;Indeed, strong observational evidence and results from modeling studies indicate that, at least over the last 50 years, human activities are a major contributor to climate change.</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to read into <em>how</em> they know, read some of these articles: <a href=""https://www.edf.org/climate/what-sparked-global-warming-people-did"">Environmental Defense Fund</a>, <a href=""https://ams.confex.com/ams/Annual2006/techprogram/paper_100737.htm"">greenhouse gas radiation</a>, <a href=""http://www.pnas.org/content/106/6/1704.abstract"">human carbon output relation to rising temperatures</a>, <a href=""http://science.sciencemag.org/content/321/5889/680"">ice core data</a>.</p>

<p>You get the point. I cannot see how any person can conclude that human activity DOESN&#39;T contribute to current climate change trends. Of course, it is a fallacy to say that something is true because an expert says it is true. However, science relies on inductive reasoning from a large set of empirical data to formulate theories and generalized hypotheses. Arguing that global warming is not caused by humans is akin to arguing that gravity does not exist, purely because we have yet to find a counterexample.</p>

t3_29c3ml	CMV: I don't find anthropogenic global warming an interesting issue.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have never really been interested in the whole man-made global warming issue. </p>

<p>I have strong positions on certain <em>philosophical</em> questions - for example, I am confident that God does not exist and that morality is as objective as physics. However, empirical questions like global warming are less interesting to me because they depend so much on analysis of details. (By &quot;empirical questions&quot; I mean questions that depend more strongly on experimental evidence than on reflection on everyday experience or our knowledge of history.)</p>

<p>There is an exception to my impatience with empirical issues, which is the debate over the theory of evolution. I like studying the evidence for the theory of evolution, although I am very far from a biologist, because it is a paradigmatic example of settled science that almost all relevant scientists accept. I have read things that suggest that most scientists also think that global warming is happening and is caused by man, but I am not certain that that is actually the consensus. </p>

<p>If it&#39;s relevant, my political views are influenced by libertarianism and Ayn Rand&#39;s Objectivism. If I became convinced that global warming was happening due to human intervention in the environment, I would not be in favor of regulating the economy to lessen greenhouse gas emissions, because my understanding is that the major effects of global warming would happen after we are all dead anyway.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there always has been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that &quot;my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.&quot;</p>

<p>I claim that 
a) this culture exists and is prominent
b) anti-vaxx and climate change denial are both consequences of this
c) anti-intellectualism contributes to these causes equally.</p>

<p>My main argument hinges on the fact that massive scientific consensus disproving these two groups’ claims are denied (and I claim that it’s because anti-intellectualism is the root.)</p>

<p>So, CMV. Deltas awarded for changing my mind on a), b), and c). </p>

The bill seems designed to raise republican opposition, and is a disappointment/insulting for people who believe that climate change is the #1 issue of our lifetime."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I would first recommend reading <a href=""https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres109/BILLS-116hres109ih.pdf"">The Green New Deal</a> if you haven&#39;t already, its about 14 pages, with huge spacing (about 3-4 real pages).</p>

<p>But to summarize the bill in my own words, the Green New Deal calls for essentially every democratic agenda to be passed into law(to include climate change). As a democrat, I agree with most of the agenda items(it&#39;s literally the democratic agenda), but there is something wrong with creating a bill like this.</p>

<p>By tying together climate change, and a plethora of other issues, like equal protection and rights for illegal immigrants, government-run(?) healthcare for all, etc, it is ensuring intense opposition by non democrats.</p>

<p>Since I do not believe any rational human being could read the bill, and think it would get bi partisan support, my view is that there was no real intention of ever getting the bill passed into law/policy.</p>

<p>(Sure, the gender wage gap is important, so are Native American rights... But there&#39;s no need to make that stand on a climate change bill, and doing so is insulting to the Americans who want to see huge climate change initiatives as our national policy)</p>

<p><strong>The abridged, loose, logical argument:</strong></p>

<p>Premise 1) If you want a bill to get passed into law, when possible, you will write it in a bi partisan way.</p>

<p>Premise 2) Climate change can be written in a Bi-Partisan way</p>

<p>Premise 3) The Green New Deal was not written in a bi partisan way(or was written in a partisan way).</p>

<p>Conclusion) The Green New Deal was not written to be passed into law.</p>

<p>(And this disappoints me, because in my opinion, climate change is the #1 issue of my lifetime.)</p>

<p>________</p>

<p>Edit 1: I learned that the intent of the bill wasn&#39;t necessarily to pass something into law, but more of a political statement or some sort of rally cry. Not sure how I feel about that one or what changes, but its worth noting. (its a function of a specific type of house resolution)</p>

<p>Edit 2: After reading some of these posts, I now realize that the Green New Deal is actually divisive within the democratic party, and received a (soft) &quot;bipartisan&quot; rejection in the senate. This seems to indicate the increased importance of having a specific targeted bill, as it seemed some senators did not want to go on record supporting it, because of what it said.</p>

t3_dai83d	"CMV: Greta Thunberg is a poor choice as the voice for climate change due to her age, rhetoric, and lack of academic and political experience."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>To start off, she is no doubt inspiring and clearly doing good for the world. I wish her nothing but the best, and I would much rather have her than <em>no one</em> advocating for these issues. </p>

<p>Despite that:</p>

<ul>
<li>  I think it’s fair to say that most, especially older, people will not listen to a teenager with no experience regarding climate science, no matter how accurate or precise her statements are. This is less an inadequacy of Greta, and more so that of those listening to her. The drama surrounding her age is a polarizing point that causes both sides to entrench in their positions. To further make my point I’d like to generalize a bit. Most non-conservatives will find her ideas to be self-evident, and take any criticism of her as personal attacks (against her person). However, the topic is climate change, not unnecessary attacks on teenagers. And, most conservatives will not want to “argue” what they believe as the proper climate change argument with a teenager, so unless they’re particularly open-minded, this aspect of Greta cause more damage than benefit. </li>
</ul>

<p>Respectfully, I believe a proper college-aged candidate that could rip into conservative counter points with painful accuracy and not draw unnecessary attacks on age and inexperience would be better. Lastly to this point, the authenticity of Greta is curtailed by how painfully obvious it is her speeches are not completely her own. Despite that logically not being a big deal, audiences see her speeches the same way we see parents of 9 year olds “quoting” some enlightened thing their child has said. </p>

<ul>
<li>  A rhetoric of fear, combined with any emotional misperceptions due to her age as stated in the last point, could cause the public to not take her seriously. Climate scientists, despite being right more often than not in the last few decades, have unsuccessfully predicted climate disasters throughout the years. Opponents of climate change are focused on these instances, and the rhetoric of fear and disaster (implied to be in the moderately short-term to those uniformed of climate change time-scales) could very easily make them believe this is another one of those instances.</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately, I am not educated on what alternative rhetoric would work best. Perhaps framing green energy as a missed opportunity or climate change as more optimistically avoidable would work. </p>

<ul>
<li>  This is probably my weakest point, but I think it’s fair to say that unless Greta has politically experienced people behind the scenes helping her, she will most likely miss political opportunities, or get taken advantage of. A more experienced spokesperson would have better odds of avoiding obvious political mistakes and taking advantage of political opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Lastly, as a general point, I think Greta makes it too hard for conservatives to “lose” this argument against her. Despite how nice it would feel, making it easier on opponents’ of climate change egos would probably have a net benefit in the long run.</p>

t3_7efd4n	CMV: The epistemology of climate change denial and Flat Eartherism is the same.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Their argument structures are basically the same. </p>

<p>*<em>Calling upon goons from the corner of the internet that cite nonsense sources. *</em></p>

<p>A lot of people seem very comfortable being their own climate scientist, a move they would not make for any other field.  Flat Earthers will trust the testimony of their own about someone&#39;s pseudo-study about how the curvature of the earth is impossible.</p>

<p><strong>Use the underhaned &quot;how do you know anything&quot; epistemology trick.</strong></p>

<p>Denying Ice core samples, denying moon landing/space missions because people weren&#39;t actually there.  This is an argument against knowing anything in the abstract because it ignores the information we can gather with our senses. </p>

<p><strong>Both conspiracies are easily disprovable and not cost effective to keep the ruse.  And whistle blowers would be greatly rewarded.</strong></p>

<p>Someone might win a nobel prize if they &quot;turned&quot; from the &quot;inside&quot; and demonstrated how climate change science has been a lie for decades.  If any NASA scientist admitted they have been lying about their day job that would change everything. </p>

<p><strong>Both would require millions of people lying over dozens of countries, thousands of institutions, over decades.</strong>  Again, these whistle blowers would be one of the most important people in history.</p>

<p>The amount of people needed to keep this a secret is mind boggling. </p>

<p><strong>Both are pretty obtuse when they talk about the particular scientific principles.  Pulling snippets here and there completely out of context.</strong></p>

<p>That nonsense about &quot;the climate was warming the in 70s&quot; which is false and this would not be the conclusion someone would draw if they looked at the metadata of the papers.  Flat Earthers would say the curvature of the earth is visible because our eyes/plane windows are round, or something. </p>

<p><strong>Both claim that NASA is lying to us.</strong></p>

<p>This stands on its own.  Both collect a ton of data and both groups deny all of it. </p>

<p>Accusing me of having an emotional problem with climate change deniers does nothing to affect the points I am making about their epistemology. </p>

<p>Change my view. </p>

<p>Edit: One is a positive claim, one is a negative claim.  This is a meaningful difference.</p>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_56h1b4	CMV: The threat of global warming is exaggerated.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m well aware of studies saying global warming is real, temperatures are rising by several degrees C by 2050, etc, etc. I&#39;m well aware of models saying it will cause species extinction, heat stroke, freak weather, runaway greenhouse effect, etc. etc.</p>

<p>However it seems to me that these models are making some very unreasonable assumptions, in particular they seem to treat everything else as a constant, when that is obviously not going to be the case, ie. stagnant technology. Follow my logic:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>&quot;If people keep eating chicken, eventually chickens will go extinct&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that increasing demand for chicken will result in more chicken farms.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If the population keeps growing, eventually we&#39;ll run out of housing&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that new apartment buildings and new cities will be built.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If the water level keeps rising, eventually we&#39;ll have billions of refugees&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that real estate developers will build further inland ahead of time knowing that there will be a market.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If this freak weather keeps getting worse, eventually all the storms will cause cataclysmic damage&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that we&#39;ll eventually build more resilient buildings to weather them.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If the world economy keeps expanding, the rate at which CO2 will be added to the atmosphere will increase exponentially&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that economic development will result in technological advancement and to things like better and cheaper photovoltaic cells, making rolling them out far easier.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If global warming causes the ice caps to melt, eventually the loss of reflectivity of the earth&#39;s surface will accelerate global warming&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that global warming causing desertification will increase reflectivity of the earth&#39;s surface (deserts are more reflective than forest) and thus counteract this process.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If temperatures keep rising, eventually the numbers of people dying from heat stroke in the summer will be astronomical&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that the markets will work to ensure that everyone has access to water and A/C at all times, and cultures will adjust to make wearing less clothing acceptable.</p></li>
<li><p>&quot;If temperatures keep rising, eventually the species that can&#39;t handle it will go extinct&quot; <em>sounds</em> reasonable, but doesn&#39;t take into consideration that as temperatures rise, these species and their biomes will move or be relocated further toward the poles, and the species that humanity cares about (ie bees) can be raised in air conditioned units if necessary.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, the models used by climatologists don&#39;t take into account any reasonable expectation of what humanity will do to compensate; they completely ignore the negative feedback loops. Of course, much of this will be expensive, but expensive and &quot;threat to human survival&quot; are completely different things.</p>

<p><strong><em>EDIT:</em></strong></p>

<p><strong><em>You guys do realize that this post is titled &quot;CMV: The threat of global warming is exaggerated&quot;, not &quot;CMV: There are no consequences to global warming&quot;?</em></strong></p>

t3_8sgoqo	CMV: Global warming has already doomed us all. We should devote ourselves to surviving it.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve come here because I need help. If I&#39;m wrong, then I am alienating my friends while dealing damage to a worthy cause. I really truly want to change my mind, if I can.</p>

<p>So let&#39;s start at the beginning. I am a mathematician who works in data science. I&#39;m <em>not</em> a scientist by day, but I consume a lot of science and I like to think that I understand how it works - math articles and research can be similar in some ways to the squishier subjects, but I&#39;m aware of the differences. </p>

<p>As a result, I believe I have a good handle on the current state of climate science. I believe that global warming is real, and man-made. Importantly, I have become quite fatalist about it. </p>

<p>Rising sea levels will devastate the world&#39;s population and urban development. The impending mass extinctions and other biological apocalypses will have all manner of terrifying and unforseen consequences. The condition of our soil will lead to a complete agricultural collapse, and the acidification of the ocean will make sourcing food from the ocean a distant memory. Global food shortages will lead to death, disease, and societal collapse. The frequency of extreme weather events will reach higher and higher, adding even more pressure to governments stretched to breaking point. Life on the surface of the earth, life as we know it, will likely not survive. </p>

<p>This won&#39;t happen tomorrow, of course. We&#39;ll slowly be boiled alive over the next couple of centuries. But there&#39;s <em>nothing</em> we can do to stop it. No matter how good our renewable energy becomes, all the fossil fuels will be dug up and burned by <em>someone</em>, eventually. Carbon recapture and other climate control solutions have shown no meaningful developments, and investing in finding a viable one is naive and dangerous. Even if we went carbon neutral <em>today</em>, the feedback loops have already locked in, and everything is still going to crash and burn. We&#39;re already dead - we just don&#39;t know it yet.</p>

<p>As an analogy, climate change is like lung cancer. Humanity has it. </p>

<p>Some people keep smoking, blaming anything they can think of, anything that&#39;s not their fault, anything to preserve their denial and allow them to continue unmolested. </p>

<p>Others argue we have to stop smoking, that we need treatment, that with help we can get better and beat the disease. They spend all their efforts trying to fight the deniers, secure in the feeling that if only they could get everyone to quit smoking and take this seriously we&#39;d all be OK.</p>

<p>But I think it&#39;s terminal. Treating it is just going to be an expensive waste of everyone&#39;s time. Let the smokers smoke, we should know by now that we can&#39;t stop them and shouldn&#39;t try. Instead we need to make a will, plan the funeral, and get our affairs in order. To try and shape the world that will still be here after we die. </p>

<p>The lies, posturing, grandstanding, false hope, virtue signalling, &quot;international agreements&quot;, I&#39;m so sick of it all. I have no hope for the future of humanity. I invite you to try and give me some.</p>

<p>EDIT: I didn&#39;t mean to imply that <em>everyone</em> is going to die. Delta awarded.</p>

t3_4t80nf	"CMV: Prosecuting global warming ""deniers"" is an unjust restriction on political speech."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I believe science and democracy work by free and open debate.  The way to limit the influence of bad ideas is to show they are bad ideas.  Because nobody is infallible, we need dissenting views in order to learn and make progress.  If we decide to begin limiting the influence of what we think are bad ideas by preventing them from being heard in the first place, we prevent ourselves from discovering that we are wrong when we are wrong, and halt progress.</p>

<p>An important part of the premise of this is that freedom of speech--especially political speech--has to be a matter of principle.  The whole point of having a freedom is in order to use it to say objectionable things.  Sometimes objectionable things are true, and people just don&#39;t realize that they shouldn&#39;t be considered objectionable until after people have said them.</p>

<p>EDIT: one commenter asked for examples, which I should have provided from the beginning (sorry).  one example would be Bernie Sanders&#39; campaign website promising to &quot;Bring climate deniers to justice so we can aggressively tackle climate change.&quot;</p>

t3_226dqr	CMV: I believe that climate change alarmists are all just trying to scare us.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><hr/>

<p>SIDE NOTE:
It was just a few weeks ago I was all for the dangers of Climate Change. I based my belief purely on the statistic that 98% of scientists agree that climate change is happening. I don&#39;t know if this is true, I thought it was a reasonable argument for all of us non-scientists of this world.</p>

<p>However, I&#39;ve recently come across an idea that&#39;s completely changed my view on Climate Change. Someone stated on a comment thread that most people are not aware of the complete temperature variations of earth&#39;s history. We are only looking at a small time frame of earth&#39;s history when regarding temperature changes. So like an intelligent scientist i did some research on Wikipedia. I discovered that Ice Core drilling in Antarctica was able to provide a valid reading on the earth&#39;s &quot;Normal Temperature.&quot; In just a few google searches, I finally came across a graph on Wikipedia, and from what i understand the CO2 and temperature levels have been higher in the past. And our current climate peaks seems like a recurring pattern of earth&#39;s history. This would mean that human&#39;s are not 100% the direct cause of this climate change, it could just be a natural pattern that occurs on earth.</p>

<p><strong>Here are the graphs.</strong> </p>

t3_7mahyu	CMV: Anthropocentric Climate Change cannot be proven to be catastrophic.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>My main point of contention is that the resolution of paleo-climate models MUST be lower than the resolution of modern-era temperature tracking, and in my opinion, possibly so low that they would necessarily hide dramatic short term temperature changes, such that if a global temperature/Co2 rise like today&#39;s were quickly reversed in the record we&#39;d never be able to see it due to low resolution of data.</p>

<p>So that, if the current upward trend is totally unprecedented then we are in fact making a huge judgement on it&#39;s destructive effects with no past data to back it up, or that if it is not unprecedented then it doesn&#39;t seem to have caused mass extinction in the past. </p>

t3_lttmlg	CMV: The worldwide increasing scarcity of clean water is a bigger issue than climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Freshwater, especially in developing countries, is becoming increasingly threatened. As urbanization continues, the strain on water in areas that people live in is huge and water is being sucked out of groundwater tables/aquifers many times faster than the replenishment rate. Obviously, climate change is not unrelated to this: increasing temperatures and ecosystem destruction play a large role in how much water can be extracted. However, there are two reasons I would place this specific issue above climate change:</p>

<li>The impact is much more severe, immediate, and less abstract/more tangible. Billions of people&#39;s lives (e.g. in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, etc.) are threatened as competition over water increases. People will easily devolve to violence if there are serious water shortages. Obviously, we need water for everything, but even small shortages affect the poor disproportionately (e.g. subsistence farming, areas where infrastructure already is bad, etc.). I also think climate change is too far gone now to where things like reducing emissions will not have any meaningful impact on its progress. Countries like China and India are not likely to lower emissions soon, and even if they do at some point water scarcity will still be a huge problem.</li>
<li>There is a false sense of security in wealthy nations. Because places like the US are gifted with great natural bounty, it is easy to think we are immune. But places in the Western US like California are seeing effects from drought get worse. A lot of the midwest relies on one water source: the Ogallala aquifer, which is shrinking like crazy. Our water consumption is much, much higher per capita than other countries and is only increasing.</li>
</ol>

<p>Basically I think we should put much more money and energy in improving water infrastructure/preservation than fighting climate change because we are too far gone on other aspects of climate change, as at least we can limit the impact it has on our water sources.</p>

t3_2eysjp	CMV: We should forget trying to stop or reverse climate change and instead devote time and resources to finding ways to live with it.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The materials I have read about climate change and the actions I have observed by various organizations and governments haven&#39;t convinced me that climate change is something that we can effectively fix or stop (just slow it down). For example, several developed countries are not joining the treaties that have them control their emissions and have repealed taxes on emissions. So my thought is: instead of people wasting time and resources on trying to convince governments to help with climate change, what if they try to find ways to live with it (it is a long term change so any technologies that can be developed along the way will be a major factor). Is this sustainable? What are some of the ways this can happen? etc..</p>

t3_97a6vc	CMV: The Extent of Human Impact on Global Warming Has Not Been and Cannot Be Proven with Current Technology	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I want to start off by saying that I am fully open to learning more about people’s beliefs regarding global warming and am willing to be convinced that we can measure significant <em>human impact</em> on global warming. My primary view I want addressed here, which should be seen as a cautious view stemming from general knowledge rather than a dogmatic stance, is this: Although we can <em>measure</em> many aspects of global weather phenomena, we haven’t proven and cannot prove the extent to which humans have impacted or are impacting weather on a global scale, particularly as it relates to global warming, especially not to the degree that we can argue humans are having a <em>significant</em> and <em>pervasive</em> impact on global warming.</p>

<p>Before I present arguments defending my view, I want to clarify my definition of <em>prove</em>. What I mean by <em>prove</em> is similar to the legal definition regarding proving someone guilty: there ought to be evidence <em>beyond a reasonable doubt</em> or at least <em>clear and convincing</em> evidence that global warming is both real and significantly impacted by humans. (<em>Significantly</em> here means that humans are causing global warming to an extent that it is damaging the planet and making it gradually less sustainable of life.) Although the human impact on global warming does not need to be proven beyond <em>a shadow of a doubt</em>, its existence should be clear beyond <em>a reasonable doubt</em> or at least provide <em>clear and convincing evidence</em>, which so many global warming proponents imply.</p>

<p>To simply receive a delta, you <em>do not</em> have to convince me of global warming in this regard beyond a reasonable doubt; you just need to substantively change at least <em>one</em> of my currently held views regarding global warming. (In other words, merely proposing “cosmetic” changes, such as the form of my arguments, will most likely not receive a delta.)</p>

<p>Here are several arguments defending my view: </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>1. The Scientific Method Cannot be Properly Applied to Global Warming</h3>

<p>Because earth’s weather, the system in which global warming is said to take place, is a dynamic, uncontrolled system, the scientific method cannot be properly applied to its research, since the scientific method requires, among other things, (a) limiting the factors that can affect an experiment and (b) repeating an experiment to see whether a particular result is an anomaly or a consistent effect. Due to the the limitations of current technology, we cannot do (a) to test hypotheses regarding global warming, because there are many factors beyond our control. Because we cannot do (a), we cannot do (b), since any tests we do will deal with factors that cannot be reliably repeated. As it relates to the Butterfly Effect and Chaos Theory as applied to weather, even small impacts to a dynamic system <em>could</em> have greater ramifications on that system as a whole; however, such small impacts would be too difficult to measure to determine if those impacts actually caused or influenced the greater weather pattern.</p>

<h3>2. Many Data are Unreliable</h3>

<p>Temperature, by definition, is an average of kinetic energy within a given system; that is, our <em>measurements</em> of temperature, even on a local scale (such as a city), are themselves imprecise. This observation compounds with my first point: not only are we unable to put controls on the system we’re proposing to make conclusive arguments about (i.e., the weather system), but we don’t even have the proper data with which to make conclusions even if we had better control over the system (though perhaps our data would themselves be better if our control was better). How, then, are we to draw conclusions about the effect of humans on weather on a global scale if our data gathered by some of the best instruments on even a local scale are imprecise?</p>

<h3>3. There are Historical Patterns of Global Heating and Global Cooling</h3>

<p>There are historical patterns of global heating and global cooling across the planet well before the modern era and before the current claims of humans causing global warming. History has shown that Earth goes through 20-to-40-year cycles of temperature and that natural phenomena, such as volcanic eruptions, would have greater potential to impact global weather than humans. Again, the primary view I want challenged is <em>not</em> that global warming isn’t happening (though I am happy to see arguments that show it is happening); rather, my view is that we haven’t proven and can’t prove the extent to which <em>humans</em> have impacted or are impacting global temperature. We can merely provide guesswork for how humans might be impacting global warming.</p>

<h3>4. Even Local Events are not Predicted with Great Accuracy</h3>

<p>Meteorologists’ accuracy in predicting <em>local</em> weather patterns is not even 100% a day out, not to mention weeks or months in advance. Such inaccuracy in far more simplistic local weather reporting is indicative of the lack of knowledge we have regarding the change of weather on the planet. At least some meteorological predictions exemplify this ignorance even more significantly by basing the accuracy of their prediction (e.g., 25% chance of occurring, 75% chance, etc.) on what has happened with similar weather patterns in the past. In other words, they don’t actually have enough info to understand how the present weather pattern <em>should behave</em> based on observations <em>of the present pattern</em>; rather, they look at prior patterns and try to extrapolate apparently similar data to make an educated guess. However, as I argued above, even the data we do have is imprecise, including past weather patterns, so trying to extrapolate from imprecise data is unlikely to produce accurate results, as we see with frequently incorrect weather predictions. Therefore, <em>this is not the scientific method</em>; this is meteorological gambling, and they’re placing bets on the “horse” that seems most likely to win based on which horse has won in the past. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Therefore, in summary, we simply have hypotheses related to global warming that are currently untestable or unreliably testable due to technological limitations. Thus, dogmatically asserting human behavior as a significant and pervasive cause of global warming is unjustified and unscientific.</p>

<p><strong>Secondary View</strong>: A secondary view that I am fully willing to have argued against here is: How can people, who have such a shaky scientific foundation as this, be so dogmatic that others are unscientific because they are unwilling to accept the tenets of global warming seeing that so many scientific objections abound against global warming? It seems to me that the opposite is true: proponents of global warming are themselves unscientific and presume to shield themselves from objection with a thin and pockmarked veneer of scientific reason.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just want to end by saying that I appreciate anyone who has fully read through this post and is willing to engage with me. I have tried to present my arguments strongly, but I truly am not dogmatic on any of these beliefs and am open to understanding why people believe humans are having and have had a significant impact on global warming and am willing to be convinced of such.</p>

<p>I believe global warming is real and impacted by man in a big way. But looking at certain forecasts, (e.g. sea levels will rise by ~4 meters in the next couple decades or so), I&#39;m confused as to why it&#39;s a big deal. Is it really worth us spending so very much money on climate impact reduction when we could just make Miami into New Orleans 2.0? Are there some kind of other effects that will be harmful to humans? I don&#39;t really see a big issue as it stands.</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_68a1nd	CMV:We need to begin raising our children now for the harsh realities of global warming and climate change. We are raising them far too soft for such a harsh future.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I am not the whole lewronggeneration KIDS R TOO SOFT type person but this is something I cant stop thinking about. I work with kids, specifically teens, and the difference between them and people even 6-7 years older is absolutely insane. I have talked to other people who have done this much longer than I have and they all agree, there has never been as much of a generational shift as the one in the past 5-6 or so years (except maybe the late 60s), the teenagers growing up today are radically different than they were before. The changes aren&#39;t all bad, for instance teens smoke and drink and do drugs much less, but that also plays into a general level of inexperience that they face. It feels as if teenage rebellion and risk-taking in general has become a thing of the past. 
<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/pbefPwi.png"">
A lot of teenagers simply don&#39;t go out</a>, and statistics show this, they are not &#39;hanging out&#39; with friends nearly as much. They are not getting into relationships, many are not having sex or even dating at all because of anxiety or shyness. A lot are very, very obsessed with social media, video games, their phones, texting... which is all fine, teens in the 2009-2012 generation were too, but nowadays it seems as if the other aspects of normal teenage life have basically gone away. I used to see kids hanging outside the school all the time, in parks, against the benches... its all gone now, they just head home.</p>

<p>In many ways I think the average 16 year old today acts similar to how many middle school kids were in some respects to maturity and adulthood. But in some ways they are also far more mature and respectful than 16 year olds were. Bullying went from a huge problem to seemingly non existent, and everyone is super respectful and very careful not to offend each others feelings. However these kids also BREAK DOWN at the feeling of any form of stress or anything similar to it, I have never seen such levels of anxiety. The feeling of openness means that people express every little emotion they feel, which means we often have kids openly crying and then we have other kids which encourage them to cry and to it almost becomes like a competition of who can express the most amount of emotion from the least amount of stress. The 2009-2012 kids were very different in this regard. The 2009-2012 kids seemed to be able to take some form of punishment and anxiety and not let it get to them, I think a lot of it had to do with the fact that they had dealt with adversity before, whether it be bullies or people they disliked or anxiety, they felt far more prepared. But even the 2012 kids were less prepared than say, my generation in the 90s. </p>

<p>Now these things should seem like not that bad right? But heres the thing, these kids are entering a world which is not going to be good for them, at all. We need to be raising our kids as tough as god damn possible, we need to make them face the reality that they are entering. Global warming is what I am talking about. The sheer level of destruction and horror which they will face in the future will be unlike anything our generation has ever faced, and they are about 1/3rd as well equipped to deal with it as we were. Flooding which destroys entire cities, antibiotics which begin to stop working, epidemics which wipe out populations, food prices rising from drought, mass migrations of tens of millions of people. The reality is that our first world bubble is going to be shattered, and its possible its going to be even worse than I am describing. We have no clue what kind of feedback loops are going to happen, how this will turn out. There are scenarios where half of the world population is dead by 2030 if a certain wave of feedback loops happen. We need to have our kids understand this reality, even if it upsets them, even if it makes them anxious, because this isnt some unwarranted anxiety like getting murdered or something, this is fucking real as hell. And the whole world will experience it.</p>

<p>We are raising our kids with this idea that the future will be better or just the same as today, and that is so far from the truth. We are raising them to be softer instead of tougher, and this is going to be a problem. I am a firm believer in the idea of stoicism when faced with unavoidable pain, not like full stoicism but a bit, and we need to learn to have these kids deal with problems and emotions instead of letting them overcome them. This is the exact OPPOSITE of how we should be raising our kids for the future. I believe if times are good and we know they will be good, we raise our kids to be softer and kinder. Times are not going to be good, so we raise our kids to be tougher and more prepared emotionally, physically, and mentally. </p>

t3_bz3a5d	CMV: Climate Change is bad for humans	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We are living in an era where climate change is a political matter rather than a scientific one, primarily due to the amount of sacrifice needed to ensure less CO2 emissions in the near and distant future, affecting economies of nations. The truth of the matter is that the increase of CO2 in our atmosphere is a threat to everyone. The greenhouse effect would heat the Earth up on average, and cause the polar ice caps to melt, leading to the release of further greenhouse gases and the rising of the oceans. This is well-accepted by a large majority of climate scientists.</p>

<p>&#x200B;</p>

<p>In this scenario, humans on coasts would have to relocate inland or build expensive structures to protect coastal cities. More pressingly, certain places would experience an influx of climate refugees, either due to crop failure or the flooding. This is overall not a sudden process, and would develop alongside the population heading towards 11 million so that overpopulation and the climate lead to a global state of change. While it would be no apocalypse, and it&#39;s within reason to believe modern technology and innovations will allow for crops to keep yield and for society to function, the worldwide economy would be on a slowdown for a very, very long time. And this is assuming that the places not affected as severely by climate change devote resources to provide a new beginning for climate refugees. These problems will be passed down for a few generations, at least. While it&#39;s within reason to believe that there is an end, the total decline in this situation is not worth the current rate of economic and technological progress until the downturn. While it is true that some people treat it like the apocalypse wrongly, it&#39;s beyond a doubt not good for humans. And I have to specify for humans, not Earth, because humans will be affected. The increase in CO2 and heat will actually boost the reproductive efficiency of some animals and all plants.  </p>

<p>It should be added that the economic efficiency of nations does not have to be threatened by lowering CO2 emissions, as wind and hydroelectric power has developed to the point of being cost efficient enough to produce a similar amount of energy, without further resource (coal, etc.) input, saving money over time. Nuclear is also a viable option, with the only downside being nuclear waste. Solar energy and geothermal energy are admittedly not viable alternatives economically at the moment. But the point is, enough development has happened in alternative energy for there to be change without threatening the economy of the nation implementing this change. And again, in the long run well-maintained renewable systems will in fact save money and effort.</p>

I think we should be more sure of the claim before we start crippling our economy and giving more power and money to the government.</p>

t3_5hb12s	CMV:Global warming is OK	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I believe the climate is changing. I believe the world is getting warmer. I believe CO2 levels are rising. I believe the ocean level is rising.</p>

<p>But, why are we fighting to stop climate change? Isn&#39;t it natural? Won&#39;t we have more farmland as the north opens up? Won&#39;t we have more rainfall, thus less water scarcity? The oceans are rising, sure, but only like 20cm a year. So as long as we elevate the shorelines by 1cm every 5 years in the lowest shores, we should be fine. If it gets 2 or 4 degrees warmer, won&#39;t it just be like living in a climate that&#39;s like a 3h drive south (I&#39;m in Canada)? Isn&#39;t CO2 good for plants? Can&#39;t species that are temperature sensitive just move a bit north?</p>

<p>I&#39;m especially not worried about humans, who seem to live comfortably at any temperature and who can thermally control buildings and who can creatively solve a wild array of unpredictable problems and who are already solving the predictable ones. We can build walls to hold back oceans, breed new crops to handle differences in climate, predict coming storms, build stronger buildings, move north, and we have to do all of this at a glacial pace, because the Earth is getting warmer so so slowly.</p>

<p>There&#39;s 55 million people collectively living in Syria and Iraq, where ISIS owns about half the land. Surely, if humans can live with ISIS in a land where everything is dust and sand, we can handle a very slightly warmer Earth.</p>

<p>EDIT: Some extra clarifications of my opinions:</p>

<ul>
<li>I believe that humans are the primary cause of global warming.</li>
<li>I believe that protecting the environment has its own benefits, like, don&#39;t burn down rainforests. They&#39;re amazing.</li>
<li>I believe that oil spills are bad, because they make a landscape toxic and that&#39;s bad.</li>
<li>I believe that China&#39;s environmental policy is disgusting and has terrible health effects.</li>

<p>My points:
1. The earth has been around 5 billion years. We aren&#39;t gonna break it after 100 years of pollution. 
2. We barely know what tomorrow&#39;s weather is going to be, let alone what the average temperature is 25 years from now.
3. Humanity can&#39;t even take care of itself, let alone trying to save the damn planet.</p>

<p>I&#39;m open to supportive, referenced data showing * <strong><em>serious</em></strong> * damage (and don&#39;t give me that ozone layer stuff).</p>

t3_aq2hcg	CMV: The Green New Deal was poorly designed	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Alexandra Oscasio Cortez released her &quot;Green New Deal&quot; last week, which consists of calls for net-zero carbon emissions, job guarantees, free higher education, among other things.  </p>

<p>I believe that while well-intentioned, the few of its provisions that aren&#39;t hopelessly vague are ill-conceived and could be much improved.  Here are my three main criticisms and alternatives:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>The call for net-zero carbon emissions is stupid.  Climate change is obviously real and has costs, but these costs aren&#39;t infinite, and in fact have been estimated to be about $40 per ton of CO2. (<a href=""https://www.edf.org/true-cost-carbon-pollution"">https://www.edf.org/true-cost-carbon-pollution</a>).  The current problem is that our markets are not taking into account this social cost, and thus we are vastly over-utilizing fossil fuels above what is optimal.  However, this not imply that we should reduce fossil-fuel use 100% in ten years.   Instead, we can have an efficient, market driven solution in the form of a $40/ton carbon tax that will naturally reduce emissions to an optimal level, rather than some arbitrary one decided by Cortez.  A carbon tax is a far more elegant, efficient, and easier-to-implement solution than whatever vague hodgepodge of inefficient regulations Cortez plans to introduce.  </p></li>
<li><p>Cortez wants to address income inequality and job availability.  That sounds good to me, except I think a federal job guarantee is a bad way to go about it.  We&#39;re at 4% unemployment, there&#39;s no reason the government needs to be paying people to do little more than dig holes and fill them up again.  If Cortez has concrete plans for useful infrastructure that will happen to employ people, great, but creating jobs for the sake of creating jobs is not an efficient use of labor resources.  Instead, to provide people a living wage in jobs that are actually useful, I propose we slightly increase the minimum wage to $10 and vastly expand the Earned Income Tax credit to subsidize the minimum wage up to a livable level without creating unemployment that an excessive minimum wage would.  </p></li>
<li><p>I believe that higher education should be more affordable, but that said, I don&#39;t think everyone should go to college.  College is a large investment, and not everyone is smart enough or hard-working enough to be worth that investment.  I would prefer vastly subsidizing college to students who have a strong academic record, and providing subsidized trade education to those that don&#39;t. </p></li>
</ol>

<p>All in all, Cortez seems to have tunnel vision, looking for whatever solution to our pressing problems seems the most flashy or exciting rather than what would actually be best for the country.  And it&#39;s for this reason I have little respect for her or her green new deal.  </p>

t3_9m6jsb	CMV: Global warming can only be stopped by a carbon tax	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve linked a whole conversation here about people wanting to use carbon removal methods.  Obviously, carbon removal is possible, but persuade me there is a net energy benefit and a technology that is profit making to remove carbon.  For instance, is there a profit making venture to burn coal, that can then extract the emitted carbon, and turn it back int a solid for a profit, and reubry it, with the whole process being postion for profit and a net carbon reduction ?     ; <a href=""https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9m5af1/climate_scientists_meeting_in_korea_are_being/"">https://old.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/9m5af1/climate_scientists_meeting_in_korea_are_being/</a>  ;  I am beginning to notice a &quot;Carbon tax&quot; hurts the poor argument present. All taxes hurt the poor if the tax revenues are diverted to the rich So, that is simply a matter of political control of the use of government revenues, which is a social issue. Not a technical / economic issue. I am look for a technical / economic alternative to a carbon emission tax. If it has a social can do aspect to it, all the better. An objection to a carbon tax that the rich will steal it and use it to purchase yachts and build big homes in Aruba, is not an objection I will accept, because that is based on the assumption that government corruiption cannot be overcome. </p>

t3_bry62p	CMV: People don't care enough about climate change in the USA because the main stream media doesn't cover it.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Seriously, try it. Go to CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC News, ABC News... not a single one will have a Climate Change centered headline, and if they do, it won&#39;t be there for more than 24 hours. And you know why? Because &#39;news&#39; is something that happens like a surprise. The &#39;surprise&#39; will be on the news for 24 hours because it keeps people&#39;s attention, but by the time 24 hours is up the draw to it has lessened and people won&#39;t pay as much attention to it- which reduces viewing of the new platform&#39;s website, TV channel, etc. So of course the main stream media won&#39;t cover it, because it&#39;s a long term issue.</p>

<p>That makes sense, but at the same time that means people won&#39;t be aware of it and will be much more skeptical of it when a headline about climate change does become relevant for a few days. I personally believe that Climate Change is the greatest threat to humanity long term outside of possible Nuclear Wars, and it&#39;s rather ironic that new sources &#39;dedicated&#39; to informing the public barely cover an issue that is killing and will kill thousands to millions of people around the world. </p>

<p>So please, change my view- the main stream media is at fault for the lack of awareness and care about climate change in the United States of America.</p>

t3_4t84hm	CMV: Renewable energy will fail if it reaches over half of a region's electricity supply without a monopoly/oligopoly of power suppliers.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Mainly talking about wind/solar via an economic argument. Could be forced by government intervention, but I don&#39;t see how it could economically work in the long-run with high renewables market share. My idea behind the opinion is one I thought of as I hear about Hawaii, New York, and other states looking to get to over 50% of power supply within a couple decades.  In a nutshell, I believe that power prices would collapse to such unsustainable levels once a large renewables market share is reached.  In essence, once installed (which takes a large upfront cost) renewable power (wind/solar) is essentially free to operate. The incremental cost of running a windmill to the system or solar system to the grid is minimal. Power demand fluctuates largely throughout the day, and bidding for power supplies is done at regular intervals for particular time periods.  This means that for a large part of the day, the grid could run entirely on renewable power.  This means that if there are more than a couple of renewables companies, they could essentially bid towards their low variable cost structure (which they all would have). They would likely end up bidding down to negative prices in which they are paying power providers to take the power off their hands. This is due to government subsidies allowing their prices to go negative, and we&#39;ve even seen this happen last year in parts of Texas. Obviously this assumes there is competition in a fair market system of bidding. The only system I know well is ERCOT, where all electricity providers are paid the price of the highest bid for the needed demand at a particular time period. With this structure, the renewable companies could fight for the market share in much of the day, bidding down to very low prices. For those parts of the day, they wouldn&#39;t be making much, if any, money unless there was collusion. The renewable companies would be making real money only in parts of the day when demand requires prices to go higher to more normalized levels where gas/coal/other needs which require a higher variable cost are also necessary.  The government could force this with a price floor or higher subsidies, but that would inevitably mean the average Joe would be footing the bill, which makes little economic sense. Also, this would rely entirely on the government&#39;s continued support. I&#39;m a relatively rational guy, please change my view.</p>

t3_e86fks	CMV: The only potential solution to global warming is anti-greenhouse chemistry.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Synopsis: I believe that by the time the Keeling Curve was a thing, greenhouse gas emissions were inevitably going to change our climate based on projected industrial and transportation needs.</p>

<p>And despite the development of some pretty amazing &#39;green&#39; technology, like super-batteries and changes to agriculture and manufacturing processes, it is already inevitable that the world will become less habitable in future decades.</p>

<p>I believe that even switching over to all the best methods we have overnight, it is already too late. And I believe there is <em>no way</em> it will happen with any speed, regardless of what treaties we sign.</p>

<p>Sure, we can slow down the rate things get worse, but I don&#39;t believe it will do anything but extend the window for a real solution. </p>

<p>And I think the only real solution - if even this is possible - is climate engineering.</p>

<p>I think that we <em>must</em> develop some kind of carbon and methane binding agent, or an albedo booster, or <em>something</em> that counteracts the warming effect. We cannot depend on reducing our ecological footprint as a standalone solution.</p>

<p>Change my view.</p>

t3_26f769	CMV: Rapid climate change today has been caused almost entirely by humans.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I believe this because of the correlation that I see between the start of the industrial revolution and the following evidence for climate change. </p>

<p><a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence"">http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence</a></p>

<p>many of the things on this page support this idea, including a graph showing that CO2 levels have never been high than they are now, even though they rise and fall in cycles. Additionally, the earth&#39;s global temperature is expected to rise 7 degrees celsius in the next  100 years, despite the fact that the global temperature as long as humans have been around has hovered with in +/- 1 degree. How is it possible that the temperature is all of a sudden changing if not for the huge increase in emissions of green house gases. CO2 and methane specifically, leading to the greenhouse effect. What other possible explanation is there for such a rapid change in climate if not for humans? </p>

<p>I would also like to add that I understand that CO2 (and greenhouse gases in general) cannot account for the entire increase in global temperature. I do believe, however, that the positive feedback provided by the melting of the ice caps (lost ice no longer reflects light energy out into space) amplifies our impact. This amplification, i think, can account for the changes we are seeing in our world. </p>

<p>evidence would be greatly appreciated also if you comment. Thanks!</p>

t3_lp6qp7	CMV: Democracies cannot solve the existential threat to humanity that is climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Democracies are inherently flawed when it comes to solving long term problems. Elections are so frequent that it causes government to prioritize short term goals in order to be reelected. This is obviously a problem when there&#39;s a threat on the horizon that may not fully manifest for 50-100 years. Climate change as it&#39;s currently progressing will cause unimaginable human suffering and will damage the world&#39;s ecosystems beyond repair. Humanity has already crossed the point of no return, from today onwards any action we take will simply mitigate the already catastrophic damages that will occur. Therefore, the world needs to reorganize itself in such a way that any and all changes to combat climate change need to be taken.</p>

<p>So if no democracies then what should take its place? Honestly, I don&#39;t know. The change I&#39;m suggesting is already such a fantasy that whatever is supposed to replace democracies is equally as fantastical. However, it would have to be a system that actively suppresses certain liberties that we take for granted in democracies. Access to luxuries that contribute a great deal to greenhouse gas emissions such as fancy cars, cruise ship vacations, and developments that clear large swaths of nature for very few people need to cease immediately. Our choice of foods need to be restricted so that what we grow or raise needs to produce as few emissions as possible. Those with extreme wealth tied to fossil fuels need to have their assets confiscated and used to promote renewable and other low emission sources of power. Perhaps even basic liberties such as the ability to travel need to be hindered in order to lower emissions of said travel. I do not know what system of government would be best to implement these changes, but I know for certain that democracies can&#39;t do it.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll end by clearing a few assumptions. I live in a Western democracy, I understand how ironic my title must be, and perhaps how naïve I may be criticizing a system of government that I&#39;ve lived in my entire life. That being said, if sacrificing luxuries and liberties lead to a future where I don&#39;t have to tell my grandchildren that everything they&#39;re watching on Animal Planet is a distant memory, I&#39;d happily make those sacrifices.</p>

t3_5ndpj8	CMV: Climate change is as serious as the media makes it out to be.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not a climate change denier, but I am not convinced that it is as potentially dangerous as we are led to believe. The platform of how it happens makes sense, but every time I try to look into it I get mixed answers of the severity ranging from doomsday scenario to mostly inconsequential. It honestly feels like even the scientists can agree with the actual impact global warming will have.</p>

<p>Further more, I feel like this can compare to what we are told by Greenpeace and the media about nuclear power. It&#39;s a common belief that events like Chernobyl could&#39;ve wiped out Europe, when even the worst case scenario would&#39;ve been a local contamination. If such widespread beliefs about these could be wrong, why wouldn&#39;t we be mislead about climate change? I use this as an example because mistruths about nuclear power are much easier to debunk than climate change.</p>

<p>So, what are the actual long-term consequences of CO2 emissions? Do we actually have an accurate long-term forecast? Does the media take the worst/best projections and present them as facts, as they do with other fields? </p>

So let me preface this by saying Im a young person who cares deeply about the future of out planet. Climate change is real, the jury is in, and we are far behind where we should be with transforming our energy systems and consumer habits. I have no ill will for Greta and think her intentions are good, however I deeply believe that she is not helpful or productive to the cause. </p>

<p>There are many in the world who share the same despair about the future and disdain for politicians who pay lip service to climate action. These are not the people we need to convince. There are many skeptics out there who doubt the science and sincerity of climate change activists and for those who we deeply need on our side, Greta is in my opinion an incredibly counterproductive force. As nice as her intentions may be, a young girl from a wealthy family who skips school and galavants the world on a private yacht meeting with celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio will not convince anybody who’s not already on board with climate change action. In the eyes of skeptics and deniers, Greta further reinforces the view of the other side as being entitled, elite, hypocritical and condescending. </p>

t3_5rwo1u	"CMV: The Lorax movie (2012) is true to its message, and is a good movie to promote environmentalism to kids."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This CMV was spurred by this video: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm6Z4U0BkY8"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vm6Z4U0BkY8</a> I like this channel, and generally like the content, even if I don&#39;t always agree with it. Anyway, the video contains most of the arguments that I&#39;m reacting to, so I probably won&#39;t be swayed by a reiteration of one of these arguments. Although, if you can bring one of their arguments into context in a way I hadn&#39;t thought of, I&#39;ll give you a delta.</p>

<p>So: I want to be aware of the message that movies and shows present to my children. I had thought that The Lorax movie (2012) was a good choice for presenting a message of environmentalism in a fun way. When it came out, I was aware of the supposed conflict of interest (the movie took money to promote a car). But I still thought that the message was sound. </p>

<p>There&#39;s even a part in the movie where the Lorax appears on an endorsement sign for the Onceler&#39;s product against his will which makes any endorsement kind of ironic. </p>

<p>The video has a few problems with the movie:
1. It does not promote its message of environmentalism well because:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>a. They made the Onceler a cool, hip Millennial. That detracts from the message. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I think that ENHANCES the message. In my opinion, the cool, relateable Onceler is a great way to drive home the message that YOU could do ill without even realizing. The Onceler in this movie is the one who moves forward with his environment-destroying factory, rationalizing along the way. All of this takes place within a song, but I think &quot;How Bad Can I Be?&quot; is a brilliant song. If it had appeared in an original film, it might be appreciated for the complexity that it shows a younger audience in a really approachable way. </p>

<p>Basically, a cool, relatable guy, who has family conflicts and plays guitar, tries to make good. He causes problems to the environment along the way by believing that he is &#39;not bad&#39;. He doesn&#39;t try to be bad. He just doesn&#39;t realize (or ignores) that his choices become increasingly &#39;bad&#39; for everyone.</p>

<p>I think this is better than just having the Onceler be a set of hands. In the original, the Onceler is many anonymous sets of hands, moving things toward a less environmentally-friendly world. I think this makes sense, but for a longer movie, making the Onceler just a normal guy was the right move. THIS is how you show that you are the Onceler in a movie of this length. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>b. There is an evil corporate villain (O&#39;hare)  to take the place of the REAL villain - The Onceler/You. He is easily defeated.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The video makes the point that the addition of a new villain takes some of the blame off of the viewer, as if saving the environment means that you have to stop an evil, external force acting out of antipathy toward the environment. When, in reality, you need to react to multiple forces, including yourself, acting in their own interest, and simply neglecting the environment.</p>

<p>I think that this is just part of it. You don&#39;t JUST solve the problems of environmentalism by personal restraint. We can&#39;t just conserve and recycle, and then everything will be alright. There really ARE external corporate forces acting in their own interest against the environment, and we need to be aware of them too. In fact, if we had to choose between recycling and conserving OR rallying to shut down a corporate interest that is harming the environment, our limited time and resources would be better spent doing the latter.</p>

<p>All said, I think that The Lorax movie is something that kids should see, and gets its message across for a new generation, but I am open to the idea that it is actually harmful to its own message because of the way that it is presented. CMV.</p>

t3_p2433x	CMV: All humans have a strong negativity bias and that's the reason why many people support depressive thinking in the face of climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The negativity bias, according to <a href=""https://healthline.com"">healthline.com</a>, is the &quot;tendency to give more importance to negative experiences than to positive or neutral experiences.&quot;</p>

<p>It is also the &quot;tendency to focus on the negative even when the negative experiences are insignificant or inconsequential.&quot;</p>

<p>The negativity bias is what happens when you look at a situation, and you only see the negative. The negative stands out immensely and now you can&#39;t see any positive answers or routes. The negative is the only thing that matters in your mind now, so you barely think about the more positive and neutral aspects of your situation.</p>

<p>All of this negativity about climate change is unproductive and unhelpful. If a person really wanted to save the children and change the world for the better, they wouldn&#39;t be pushing this doom and gloom crap so hard. It&#39;s the same thought process as &quot;I&#39;m going to die anyway, so what&#39;s the point of being happy today?&quot; It doesn&#39;t help you or anyone else, and it can actually cause depression in other people too. All you did was spread your negativity and toxicity to other people. That is actually not a good thing, believe it or not.</p>

<p>In fact, I would argue that it&#39;s selfish to say all of this crap about climate change, children, and death. Why can&#39;t children have a good life right now? Why can&#39;t you give a child a happy life, despite the situation? Millions of people live in severe poverty, and poor people have always existed, but many of them have given their children love and joy. The only person stopping you from doing good is yourself. You are the one stopping yourself from being kind and loving; it isn&#39;t the climate or the trillionaires stopping you. Instead of inseminating or giving birth, just adopt a child. The orphans will need parents during the before and after. You are so busy thinking about people who don&#39;t even exist, that you forgot about the people who do exist or will exist. Natural disasters and war aren&#39;t good reasons to abandon life.</p>

<p>Pushing this depressive, apocalyptic thinking puts a road block in front of lots of people. It stops them before they have even made an attempt. And honestly, so what if the planet will die. So what if people will die! Yes, that&#39;s messed up. But that doesn&#39;t mean you shouldn&#39;t live the best life you can live in the face of death. And many people who are complaining about climate change haven&#39;t had any serious losses because of pollution and global warming. So why would you want to force people to feel hopeless and scared when nothing has happened to them?</p>

<p>Humans have a strong tendency to obsess over and believe in the worst possibility they can imagine. I believe that is the easiest thing humans can do. It is extremely easy to come to the conclusion that everything is hopeless and we&#39;re all going to die. Or we should all die. If the planet does die, and humans die with it, does that not give you reason to live life to its fullest? Would you tell a cancer patient who has 10 or 20 years to live that he should just give up? He should just waste his life on feeling depressed and scared?</p>

<p>It has been said many times that if you or someone else tells you &quot;You are going to fail&quot; or &quot;Something will go wrong&quot; then those things will come true. Personally speaking, there is a lot of truth to that. If you tell yourself something, and you do it repeatedly, it&#39;s going to have negative effects just like you predicted. It doesn&#39;t do you or anyone else good.</p>

<p>This whole conversation is about a predetermined prophecy. It&#39;s pointless and stupid. Enjoy your life while you can. Help people. Don&#39;t tell people to feel depressed and fearful. (It seems misery loves company, though).</p>

<p>Point is, don&#39;t push your beliefs and toxicity onto other people. It is selfish and it ruins life for people. Humans die no matter what is happening to their planet, so why give up now? Just do what you can when you can, and that applies to climate change doomers.</p>

t3_8t5hur	CMV: A carbon tax will help fight climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I think that we need a carbon tax or something similar that taxes companies for the amount of greenhouse gases they produce to help deal with climate change. If we tax companies that produce greenhouse gases then they have a financial incentive to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases they produce. </p>

<p>Companies could be taxed per ton of greenhouse gases they produce and the amount that they get taxed could increase every year. The money earnt from the tax could be put towards making renewable energy plants, electric cars or nuclear power plants (maybe not the last one). </p>

<p>I think that the biggest probably won&#39;t change is that there&#39;s no real financial incentivise for reducing the amount of carbon we produce and it can be very expensive to solve. </p>

t3_be5rsm	CMV: It's increasingly unlikely that Climate Change will be meaningfully mitigated and there's very little we (as individuals) can do about it.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>This post has the starting assumption that Climate Change is real and that humans have a real and noticeable impact on the global climate. This has been <a href=""https://climate.nasa.gov/"">very well documented</a> by now and I&#39;m not interested in attempts to change my view on this matter by addressing this assumption. (Also: Sorry about the length.)</p>

<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>Most of the world is currently very much aware of Climate Change happening and its effects. People might argue over the specifics or might be unaware of the exact effects that might occur at what time but the debate has noticeably shifted from whether or not Climate Change and its effects are real and worth worrying about to what our response should be. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, the <a href=""https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/science-and-impacts/global-warming-impacts"">effects of Climate Change</a> are already seen in the world, <a href=""https://19january2017snapshot.epa.gov/climate-impacts/international-climate-impacts_.html"">mostly affecting the poorest people in the world</a> but also the US and Europe with <a href=""https://www.carbonbrief.org/factcheck-how-global-warming-has-increased-us-wildfires"">larger and more frequent wildfires</a>, increases in the <a href=""https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/global-warming-and-hurricanes/"">number and intensity of tropical storms</a>, <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/04/world/europe/europe-heat-wave.html"">warmer summers</a>, and <a href=""https://www.climatechangepost.com/belgium/droughts/"">droughts and water scarcity</a>.</p>

<p>We also see the effects on the geopolitical level, with <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syrian_Civil_War#Drought"">a drought</a> being partially responsible for the Syrian Civil War and the ensuing migrant crisis.</p>

<p>The response, so far, has not been in proportion to the oncoming problems. The Paris Climate Accords <a href=""https://www.nature.com/articles/nature18307#change-history"">aren&#39;t adequate</a> to prevent or mitigate the worst effects and most countries <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2018/10/11/few-countries-are-meeting-paris-climate-goals-here-are-ones-that-are/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5c6feda47def"">aren&#39;t even on track to meeting them</a>. Following the Paris Accords would still lead to at least a 2.5°C increase in global temperature, <a href=""http://globalwarming.berrens.nl/globalwarming.htm"">which is bad enough</a> but seeing as that&#39;s not happening, we&#39;re looking <a href=""https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_campaign=Redirect#"">at worse</a>. </p>

<p>Mainstream political  and media reaction has been <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/trump-administration-sees-a-7-degree-rise-in-global-temperatures-by-2100/2018/09/27/b9c6fada-bb45-11e8-bdc0-90f81cc58c5d_story.html?utm_term=.c68afb5c821c"">denial or acceleration</a> at worst and insufficient agreements (such as the aforementioned Paris Accords) and addressing the <a href=""https://www.independent.ie/regionals/goreyguardian/lifestyle/tackling-climate-change-is-is-everyones-responsibility-36099475.html"">individual&#39;s responsibility</a>.</p>

<p>I&#39;m writing a thorough introduction to set a consensus moving forward and to show that my view and the associated worries are not baseless. In the rest of this post I will develop my view further, addressing both aspects somewhat in-depth. I&#39;ll start by explaining why I think meaningful action towards stopping, slowing, or mitigating the effects of Climate Change is unlikely, followed by explaining why I think we, as individuals, can&#39;t do very much about it.</p>

<h1>Getting worse</h1>

<p>As I already addressed in my introduction, the current agreements are <a href=""https://www.bettermeetsreality.com/forecasts-projections-for-climate-change-global-warming-for-the-future-up-to-2100/"">insufficient</a> to assure the best possible outcomes and those agreements <a href=""https://climateactiontracker.org/countries/"">aren&#39;t being followed.</a> A two degree warming is being portrayed as a reasonable goal, but it&#39;d already be <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-worst-case-scenario-bill-mckibben-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T"">really</a>, <a href=""https://www.wri.org/blog/2018/10/half-degree-and-world-apart-difference-climate-impacts-between-15-c-and-2-c-warming"">really</a> <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2018/1/19/16908402/global-warming-2-degrees-climate-change"">bad</a>.</p>

<p>Apart from government and international governmental agencies being insufficient we also have companies <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/norway-bets-on-global-warming-to-thaw-arctic-ice-for-oil-and-gas-drive/"">eager to drill for oil in areas that were previous inaccessible</a>. <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-01-22/muggy-disney-parks-downed-at-t-towers-firms-tally-climate-risk"">Other companies</a> are also seeing financial opportunities in Climate Change.<a href=""https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/11/survival-of-the-richest-the-wealthy-are-plotting-to-leave-us-behind.html"">The super-wealthy are planning for their own survival</a> rather than trying to fix things for everyone and <a href=""https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/climate-change-will-get-worse-these-investors-are-betting-on-it"">are looking to profit of the effects of Climate Change to fund it</a>.</p>

<p>The people with actual power are either not making effective changes or are benefiting from the lack of policy. And I realize that <a href=""http://re100.org/companies"">some companies</a> are claiming they&#39;re looking to make a change. I have little faith in this for two reasons. First, companies are really good at <a href=""https://mic.com/articles/116564/john-oliver-nails-the-massive-problem-of-the-human-cost-of-shockingly-cheap-clothes#.gZqxjLxB0"">outsourcing their worst practices</a>, meaning there&#39;s a good chance they&#39;ll meet their self-imposed goals by having outside contractors incur the real cost. The second reason is that this list is a drop in the bucket compared to <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2017/jul/10/100-fossil-fuel-companies-investors-responsible-71-global-emissions-cdp-study-climate-change"">the companies most responsible for carbon emissions</a>. These companies are engaging in <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing"">greenwashing</a> because it&#39;ll help sales and/or to dissuade people from questioning their actual environmental impact. (For example, one company on the list I linked to is HP, which is also pretty known for its <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidschrieberg1/2017/09/26/landmark-french-lawsuit-attacks-epson-hp-canon-and-brother-for-planned-obsolescence/"">planned obsolescence</a>, <a href=""http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20160612-heres-the-truth-about-the-planned-obsolescence-of-tech"">which further contributes to Climate Change and other environmental damages.</a>)</p>

<p>The <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/"">IPCC Report</a> that was in the media recently, which is working on a very cautious 1.5 degrees increase, basically states that <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/energy-environment/2018/10/08/world-has-only-years-get-climate-change-under-control-un-scientists-say/?utm_term=.e7c1d3335b59"">we need drastically and radically change the way we organize society and the economy on a global level</a>. We&#39;ll need an unprecedented level of global cooperation to <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/climate-change-worst-case-scenario-bill-mckibben-2017-8?r=US&amp;IR=T"">ensure that humanity as we know it survives the next century</a>.</p>

<p>Given the general slowness of political decision-making and the unambitious goals countries set themselves, paired with the incentives companies have to keep churning out money, it seems to me that we won&#39;t be seeing the necessary changes quickly enough. We have about <a href=""https://earther.gizmodo.com/we-have-a-decade-to-prevent-a-total-climate-disaster-1829585748"">a decade</a> to completely turn around everything and put all our efforts towards creating a world that we might survive.</p>

<p>On a more personal note, in my country one of the climate ministers (yes, we have multiple) took no meaningful actions at <a href=""https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2018/12/16/belgian-ngo_s-react-with-disappointment-to-katowice/"">a climate summit</a> after <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-climatechange-belgium-demonstration/thousands-march-peacefully-in-brussels-against-global-warming-idUSKBN1O10HS"">one of the largest demonstrations in the history of this country</a> asked for ambitious policy. This is anecdotal, of course, but it is also symptomatic on how climate policy is decided. Most people are aware of how bad it is and want politicians to take action, but the response is always lacking and <a href=""https://corporateeurope.org/en/climate-and-energy/2018/11/coal-king-un-climate-talks-poland"">organizations responsible for global warming get a seat at the table.</a></p>

<p>Seeing that we won&#39;t see the required actions in time, that means we&#39;re likely to hit <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/global-warming-point-of-no-return-temperature-2018-8?r=US&amp;IR=T"">a point of no return</a> where <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252"">all sorts of feedback loops might lead to worse and worse changes</a>. </p>

<h1>A brief note on geo-engineering</h1>

<p>A lot of people will point to possible future advances in science and technology that could help us. I&#39;m not confident in them for two main reasons. As the IPCC report points out, those methods are currently untested, especially at a global scale. <a href=""https://www.ciel.org/reports/fuel-to-the-fire-how-geoengineering-threatens-to-entrench-fossil-fuels-and-accelerate-the-climate-crisis-feb-2019/"">We can&#39;t rely on them to fix things and we can&#39;t even rely on them not making things worse.</a> Given the brief window of time we have to work with here, we would basically need the technology ready to go right now. The second objection to it is that massive climate or geo-engineering might help deal with global warming but <a href=""https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-30197085"">could destroy the ecosystem in a variety of different ways.</a> <a href=""https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/what-happens-if-we-start-geo-engineeringand-then-suddenly-stop/551354/"">We also wouldn&#39;t be able to stop</a>.</p>

<h1>Why individuals won&#39;t be able to do anything</h1>

<p>This is hyperbole, of course. <a href=""https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/wg3/"">An earlier IPCC report</a> points to several things you can do, especially if you live in a richer country. The most impactful things you can do are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having less children</li>
<li>Not having a car</li>
<li>Not taking planes</li>
<li>Eating a plant-based diet</li>
</ul>

<p>And I&#39;m not saying you shouldn&#39;t do those things. As I said above, we need <strong>everyone</strong> to pull together if we want to make it. </p>

<p>I also know that some of you will have see the link to article about 100 companies producing most of the carbon emissions and went: &quot;<a href=""https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17967738/climate-change-consumer-choices-green-renewable-energy"">Ah, you see, but these companies are producing the goods and fuel the individual consumers demand.</a>&quot; To which there are two obvious answers. First, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/08/exxon-climate-change-1981-climate-denier-funding"">these companies have deliberately withheld information from consumers and regulators</a> that could have been valuable in addressing Climate Change sooner. These companies are also spending <a href=""https://www.opensecrets.org/lobby/indusclient.php?id=E01"">a shitton of money</a> on <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/mar/22/top-oil-firms-spending-millions-lobbying-to-block-climate-change-policies-says-report"">influencing policy</a>. The power consumers have here pales in comparison to that of international companies. The second answer is more prosaic: People have no choice but consumption. If you want a house and food, you need a job. To have a job, you need a car and a phone. While some people are in a position to make certain lifestyle choices, not everyone has that luxury. Without societal transformation and <a href=""https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2018/10/12/17967738/climate-change-consumer-choices-green-renewable-energy"">policy tying it all together, these choices are academical to a lot of individuals</a>. (Also worth noting that air-travel is something people already avoid due to cost, making it only a solution for those that are already affluent enough to fly.)</p>

<p>As I addressed above, that policy is unlikely to happen in a timely fashion.</p>

<p><a href=""http://theconversation.com/beyond-light-bulbs-individual-responsibility-and-climate-action-12184"">Individuals organizing without governmental backing is valuable</a> but limited in what can be achieved. It also doesn&#39;t address the core problems with our model of consumption that lies at the root of what is causing climate catastrophe. Actions that actually challenge to logic of putting financial gain before the climate are <a href=""https://earther.gizmodo.com/south-dakota-governor-introduces-laws-to-kill-keystone-1833062437"">criminalized</a> or meet the <a href=""https://www.dw.com/en/no-chance-of-saving-hambach-forest-says-rwe-boss/a-45698266"">already existing government protections of companies.</a> </p>

<p>You could also say that voting is a way for individuals to influence the policy level. While this is somewhat true, it also ignores that between voting, policy makers are free to <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-green-new-deal-support-among-americans-poll-2019-2?r=US&amp;IR=T"">lay aside the demands of the public</a>, most people vote for more than climate policy, and we&#39;ve increasingly seen how our democratic process can be led astray by <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/final-say-brexit-referendum-lies-boris-johnson-leave-campaign-remain-a8466751.html"">misinformation</a>. We also have large political groups that either deny we should be addressing Climate Change or are preferring a wait-and-see approach. </p>

<p>Given the scope and the timeline of the problem, individuals actions aren&#39;t even close to enough. While I still think you and I should be making an effort, we can&#39;t create the massive changes to our societal and economical systems we need by doing that.</p>

<h1>Changing my view</h1>

<p>I want my view changed because this is just <a href=""https://www.nbcnews.com/health/mental-health/climate-grief-growing-emotional-toll-climate-change-n946751"">very depressing.</a> I don&#39;t want to see major parts of the world dealing with flood, fire or famine (or at least not more than they already do). I don&#39;t want to deal with all the additional bad things that are going to accompany the climate catastrophe.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to be weighing whether or not to have children not just because of the carbon footprint associated with yet another human but also because I don&#39;t want to have to prepare them for a life of scarcity and extinction.</p>

<p>As for how to change my view, I genuinely don&#39;t know. I&#39;ve been reading up before making this post and things are just looking grim. Maybe I&#39;m missing something in terms of how society is on the brink of being transformed or how a global revolution is just around the corner. Maybe I&#39;m underestimating the impact of individual action.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to keep my own politics out of this post as much as possible (this is, unfortunately, a political issue) but they might be relevant for attempts to change my view. I consider myself an <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarchism"">anarchist</a>, which obviously informs my views on governments and corporations. While not extremely relevant, it might help people avoid arguments that rely on, say, assuming the free market will fix things.</p>

t3_an7578	"CMV: Full-scale collapse of modern civilisation as we know it is imminent within the century, probably much sooner. We are nearing the tipping point of runaway climate change every day and our system is too complex to overcome the challenges to prevent it."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Virtually all the world’s respected climate experts are warning us that climate change poses a potentially existential threat to humanity. Even in the best case scenario, I can see no future outcome where billions of people will not die because of problems related to climate change and other human-caused factors before the end of the century. I will explain my reasoning for this and I would love for you to be able to change my view.</p>

<p>The recent <a href=""https://documentcloud.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Afd66a5c7-a6d0-4ec1-b66e-1392a903e239"">IPCC Special Report - Global Warming of 1.5°C</a> outlines the various implications of exceeding 1.5°C of global temperature increase to 2°C. These implications include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased precipitation in areas and reduced precipitation in others leading to gradually and exponentially increasing drought and floods across vast locations [B.1.1].</li>
<li>A myriad of impacts that will be caused by rising sea levels that primarily affect low lying islands and places near deltas [B.2].</li>
<li>Climate-related risks to health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security, and economic growth are projected to increase with global warming of 1.5°C and increase further with 2°C putting many in increased danger of famine, vector-borne illness and displacement due to no longer habitable environments [B.5].</li>
</ul>

<p>To avoid the most severe of these implications we need to reduce emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and 100% by 2050 [C.1]. Failure to meet these targets would mean a temperature rise to above at least 1.5°C and the irreversible damage that comes with it. If you believe technology will sort everything out in the future <a href=""https://ourworld.unu.edu/en/world-headed-for-irreversible-climate-change-iea"">you are mistaken</a>.</p>

<p>We have an extremely limited timeframe to make significant changes to the entire global infrastructure of the developed world as well as rapidly developing smaller countries. Even if every nation in the world could agree to work together, it is next to impossible to see how we could completely negate carbon emissions to net zero within the next 30 years.</p>

<p>At current rates, we are on course to reach <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/nov/16/climate-change-champions-still-pursuing-devastating-policies-new-study-reveals"">at least 4°C of global warming before 2100</a> which would put us into unknown territory, with unprecedented consequences. Yes, some countries are making progress towards sustainable energy, but we&#39;re not likely to reduce those rates significantly, and could even increase them by 2050 [<a href=""https://www.oecd.org/env/cc/49082173.pdf"">OECD pp.5-6</a>]. Many countries such as the US are taking massive steps in the opposite direction, e.g. pulling out of the Paris Accord (which by the way is <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jul/03/paris-climate-deal-wont-work-our-future-depends-degrowth"">not ambitious enough, non-binding and relies on technology we even don&#39;t have</a>).</p>

<p>Scientists have no sensibly conceivable ulterior motive to spend their lives creating what would have to be the most comprehensive conspiracy in all of history should it be exposed they are all lying to us. The idea that they are in it for the money is absolutely laughable, they aren&#39;t rich by any account and their careers do not depend on how drastic climate change is. The other side of the conspiracy is so blatant and logically constructed. It is in a lot of rich and powerful people’s interest that the truth about climate change remains watered-down background noise to the majority of the population. Oil industries have even been proven to be using <a href=""https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/tobacco-and-oil-industries-used-same-researchers-to-sway-public1/"">THE EXACT SAME COMPANY THAT WAS ONCE EMPLOYED BY THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY </a>to make sure people didn’t find out about the new science that proved tobacco was a harmful substance.</p>

<p>Misinformation, the lack of concern from world leaders and the general consensus (diametrically opposed to the experts) that climate change is not an important issue means that achieving zero net emissions by 2050 is not feasible. Therefore, a warming of at least 2°C is almost certainly inevitable - the best case scenario.</p>

<p>When we exceed this limit and the aforementioned implications start taking effect, mass migration and food shortages will begin on a global scale. We are already nearing crisis point with refugees, we simply will not be able to cope with entire countries migrating. Couple this with the rest of the world&#39;s problems and a predicted <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jan/05/global-economic-crash-2020-understand-why"">global market crash</a> and you have the conditions for far-right populism and fascism to rise, as we are already seeing. The people who survive the extreme weather, diseases and famine will find no asylum in the places that are not as badly affected. War caused by the climate crisis and water shortages is a definite possibility if not probability. When it starts to fall apart, everything will <a href=""https://www.pnas.org/content/115/33/8252"">escalate unforeseeably</a> and solutions will become exponentially more complicated. Many would argue it&#39;s already too late to avoid this.</p>

<p>All of this is without even mentioning the <a href=""https://globalchallenges.org/our-work/annual-report/annual-report-2017/ecological-collapse"">ecological collapse</a> and <a href=""https://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/biodiversity/elements_of_biodiversity/extinction_crisis/"">mass extinction</a> we are experiencing right now, happening at a faster and more damaging rate than we thought. People don&#39;t understand how much our existence depends on nature to sustain us. I hope the final nail in the coffin will be that climate predictions are usually on the conservative side and we are <a href=""https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/global-warming-temperature-rise-climate-change-end-century-science-a8095591.html"">more likely to see the worst case scenario unfold than the best</a>.</p>

<p>To clarify, I will be awarding deltas to anyone who convinces me that our civilisation will not collapse before 2100.</p>

t3_3b4ha5	"CMV: Even if climate change is indeed ""a hoax,"" we still benefit greatly from addressing the problem by moving to renewable energy and sustainable resources"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A lot of the Climate Change &#39;debate&#39; focuses on whether or not it&#39;s real or human-caused or not. I believe this is the wrong thing to focus on, as with or without climate change we still encounter oil spills, exploding oil/coal trains, pollution in the atmosphere, the expense of purchasing fuel for our vehicles and homes, the danger and war caused by procuring resources from overseas, the waste accumulation from non-biodegradable plastics and styrofoam materials, etc.</p>

<p>So even if we do not want to believe, or even find out, that climate change is real, we should still switch to renewable energy and sustainable resources and localized sources of energy and resources. Focusing on whether or not it&#39;s real is the wrong argument and a lost cause.</p>

t3_bkmqvb	"CMV: As long as Conservatives maintain any significant level of federal power, meaningful action to curb climate change is impossible in the US"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Right now, American conservatives are firmly in the camp of inaction when it comes to climate change. Their actual beliefs on it vary from hard/soft denialism (it&#39;s not real/it&#39;s not human caused), to wishful thinking (the effects won&#39;t be that bad and we&#39;ll adapt), all the way to nihilism (it&#39;s too late/expensive to do anything), but practically all agree that no significant action should be taken to curb it. This is evidenced by many leading Conservative voices, but most prominently by President Trump who has made trolling the left on climate change a regular habit. And conservatives seem to near universally praise him for it to the point that the few who criticize him are aggressively silenced.</p>

<p>This is all in spite of the overwhelming evidence that man-made climate change is real and could have potentially catastrophic impacts. Whether it&#39;s tidal flooding in Miami, historic level wildfires becoming a regular occurrence on the west coast (even in years with high levels of rainfall and snowpack), or the fact that 9/10 of the globally hottest years on record have occurred since 2000, even ordinary people can point to things that should convince any reasonable person of this. For this reason, I can only conclude that there is nothing that will change their stance on climate change, at least not in the ~10 year time frame (this is the time frame according to the <a href=""https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2017/3/23/15028480/roadmap-paris-climate-goals"">IPCCs roadmap</a>) we have to start taking aggressive action to curb it.</p>

<p>At this point, they seem to have become so ideologically opposed to action on climate change that it now forms a fundamental part of their identity.</p>

<p>I know I&#39;ve used some rather vague terms here, so let me clarify below:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Meaningful action:</strong> According to the IPCC, between 2020-2030, countries around the world need to start doing things like implementing ~$50/ton carbon taxes, heavily invest in research in clean energy and low carbon manufacturing processes, take Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technology from being essentially lab experiments to pulling hundreds of millions of tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere every year, and reach near carbon neutrality for developed Western countries. This is what I mean.</li>
<li><strong>Significant federal power:</strong> Any amount of federal power that could be used to block the passage or implementation of legislative or executive action to the above effect in any of the 3 branches. Essentially, I believe they must become effectively irrelevant.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Please Note:</strong> I am not and do not advocate violence towards or political repression of Conservatives. Rather, I&#39;m saying that meaningful action is essentially impossible in the US because of this.</p>

<p>I desperately do not want to believe that so long as ~1/2 of Americans have a relevant political voice, such action is impossible. Please CMV.</p>

t3_m2r8jx	"CMV: Climate change is serious, damaging, but not apocalyptic."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>EDIT 3: Alright my opinion is somewhat changed. Coming into this I really didn&#39;t see how climate change could end the world, but I can see while there is no hard evidence to say it will, the chance is much higher than I had realized. Thanks I guess lol (<em>sad human noises</em>)</p>

<p>So I will admit I used to be a climate change denier. Not anymore, I&#39;d like to think im less naive than I used to be. That said, even according to NASA&#39;s climate change page, basically what I pick up on is the weather will get more severe, coast lines will come in significantly, etc.</p>

<p>Perhaps the worst I&#39;ve heard is that it will likely have a serious effect on our ability to grow crops, especially to the degree we do now. This will lead to a significant rise in starvation and we may well face famine.</p>

<p>Now, don&#39;t get me wrong. I absolutely see the severity of that, and it is infuriating how avoidable it is. But people act like the human species is about to die out. I just don&#39;t see that happening. Frankly it seems more likely to force humanity to adjust its course than to outright stop it. </p>

<p>That&#39;s not to say some environmental damage we do isn&#39;t potentially extremely serious, for instance, letting major parts of the Amazon burn has long reaching effects beyond climate change. </p>

<p>But as far as climate change itself, I really don&#39;t see it destroying humanity. A lot of people might die and that is obviously horrible and should be prevented, but humanity isn&#39;t going to go extinct and probably won&#39;t be the most devastating thing we&#39;ve faced as a species.</p>

<p>For instance, the plague killed 60% of everyone in Europe. I might be missing something, but I don&#39;t think 60% of the world is going to die from this. And chances are, when consequences start coming in, we will probably figure something out as we always have as a species. EDIT: to be very clear, I dont think anywhere near 60% of the population will die from climate change as far as we know it right now. I&#39;d be surprised by 10-15%, but thats mostly conjecture.</p>

<p>I very well might be misinformed or missing some important part of this, but it just doesn&#39;t seem world ending to me. CMV?</p>

<p>EDIT 2: I&#39;m not at all saying climate change isn&#39;t serious and should be avoided. It is a very very bad thing. All I&#39;m saying is people say it will bring humanity to extinction and that is not my understanding based on what I&#39;ve seen.</p>

<p>Companies like <a href=""https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/sunedison-emerges-from-bankruptcy"">SunEdison</a>, <a href=""https://www.reuters.com/article/us-solyndra/u-s-solar-firm-solyndra-files-for-bankruptcy-idUSTRE77U5K420110906"">Solyndra</a>, <a href=""https://www.wired.com/2011/04/bloom-pro-subsidy-game/"">Bloom</a>,  <a href=""https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Companies/Tesla-sales-screech-to-a-halt-in-Hong-Kong"">Tesla</a>, as well as <a href=""https://www.nationalreview.com/2016/06/wind-energy-subsidies-billions/"">wind energy</a> and <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/08/business/china-trade-solar-panels.html"">Chinese Solar companies</a> are all heavily subsidized.</p>

<p>How can renewable energy truly stand on its own in the future?</p>

<p>EDIT: For example, once the first heavier-than-air flight happened we knew it was possible, just a matter of making it better. As far as renewable energy operating without subsidies, there&#39;s a lot of &quot;maybe&quot; and &quot;probably&quot; answers.

t3_paqlx8	CMV: Everyday people will have to make sacrifices/change their lifestyle for our society as a whole to combat climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I completely understand that major corporations are the cause of a majority of carbon issues and should be taking a lot of the blame for climate change. And I definitely think for us to actively combat climate change we need legislation that would restrict the use of fossil fuels and wastefulness in this major corporations. I don’t think we can combat climate change without government intervention. And I don’t buy into the “we all just need to decrease our individual carbon footprint” thing either because 1. I know that idea was created by fossil fuel companies to shift the blame for climate change off of them in to everyday people and 2. I know that data shows individuals reducing their foot print doesn’t have significant impact on climate change. </p>

<p>However, these corporations don’t exist in a vacuum. For example everyone loves to talk crap about Amazon but very few people are willing to actually give up their prime accounts. By not making any changes in our day to day lives we are continuing the success of these companies. And while we need to governments help to hold these corporations accountable we will eventually also need to make changes in our own lives. For example, we can’t take down fossil fuel companies and decrease the US dependency on oil without changing to electric vehicles or more people taking public transit. </p>

<p>Another example, the beef and dairy industry are huge polluters and while we absolutely have a ton of food waste and subsidize those industries more than we need, those industries are so strong because a ton of people consume beef and dairy. I’m not saying everyone needs to be vegan (I’m not) but to actually decrease the pollution done by this industry people would need to cut down on consumption in conjunction with ending subsidies. Many Americans eat meat with every single meal. That isn’t really something we can sustainably keep doing. </p>

<p>I think it’s ridiculous when people assert that there’s no point in individuals taking steps to be more green (like cutting out single use plastics or going vegan or buying an electric car) because “well it’s all the major corporations that are causing these problems” when we are the reasons these corporations exist. Realistically if we did hold these corporations accountable for the pollution they cause and pass legislation to be more green that would inevitably force every day people to make changes/sacrifices as well. I believe corporate accountability (through legislation or even boycotts) and individual changes are necessary to decrease climate change. </p>

<p>Im not sure I phrased this the best and I’m on mobile so forgive the formatting but to change my mind you have to prove to me that the average person would not have to change their day to day life in significant ways to combat climate change</p>

t3_lcge08	CMV: the fight against climate change will be impossible because of compromises.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;m not sure how to title this CMV, but I&#39;m starting to think that it will be impossible to stop climate change from doing too much damage, from flooding low-height densely populated areas, from making deserts (more) uninhabitable. There are too many compromises to make in order to stop the damage from being too big but also to prevent the suffering of some people.</p>

<p>1- Airplanes</p>

<p>On one hand, airplanes cause a lot of pollution because of the fuel. Kerosene is the only fuel available that is cheap, energy-dense and light to power a flying beast of metal. Batteries are too heavy and aren&#39;t energy-dense enough for that. It&#39;s almost as if human beings aren&#39;t supposed to fly. The heaviest extant flying animal has an average weight of less than 20 kg. Pterosaurs existed, yes, but they are extinct and I think they&#39;d have a hard time flying in our current atmosphere with too little oxygen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are some some places that are too geographically isolated for roads or train tracks. Yes, they are accessible by water vessels, but water-based transportation is too slow, especially for those communities who can&#39;t be self-sufficient.</p>

<p>2- The Amazon rainforest</p>

<p>On one hand, preserving it is important. Not just because of the biodiversity, but also because of its weather regulation capabilities.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the Amazon is no Antarctica, it has people living in it, it has cities in it. They need infrastructure that can&#39;t be built because of extreme environmental regulations. Yes, there&#39;s a risk of the roads and train tracks (again, water travel is slow, and not everything can be transported via ships) causing even more deforestation in their surroundings, but the Brazilian north is poor for a reason.</p>

<p>3- Energy</p>

<p>Renewable energies still can&#39;t supply the energy demand on their own and nuclear stations take too long to get ready and got their reputation destroyed by Fukushima and Chernobyl (there&#39;s also the issue of the disposal of the nuclear waste, those take literally millennia to become safe). I fear that, even with the increase of capabilities, renewables still couldn&#39;t supply because the demand also increased.</p>

<p>4- Food</p>

<p>On one hand, agriculture and livestock (especially the latter) take up too much space that could be used for nature preservation and for planting trees to suck up the excessive carbon in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are people living in places that can&#39;t support intense agriculture because the soil sucks and/or because their biome is too important (<em>cough</em> Amazon <em>cough</em>). Also, being able to follow a vegan diet is a privilege. There are the people whose lifestyle require a lot of protein, people recovering from eating disorders (they can&#39;t have a diet that is too restrictive), autistic people who only eat a very specific diet (and they are often repulsed by vegetables), people who simply can&#39;t give up meat because they like it too much, among other groups who can&#39;t go vegan.</p>

t3_al13nb	CMV: Global warming has a marketing problem	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>For some reason, Climate Science has become a polarizing, deeply political issue.  You have a bunch of people on one side pretending like they have any clue about how climate science works and then belittling the other side for saying this shit is confusing I don&#39;t believe it.  This is fueled by a president who believes in conspiracy theories and thinks cold weather disproves global warming, but also grotesquely over exaggeration and political manipulation of scientific reports.  All this has combined to turn science into a political weapon thrown around with no concern about how it affects our society.  It disgusts me when Trump says he doesn&#39;t believe scientists, it also disgusts me when AOC says we have 12 years left to live.  The reality is most people do not understand climate change and are just throwing their hats into a ring they have no business pretending to be knowledgable about.  What we have here is a marketing issue.</p>

<p>Marketing is used to sell a product.  The type of marketing that is used in politics is usually full of rhetoric and over exaggeration.  How can you belittle someone for being skeptical that if we don&#39;t sink 100s of trillions of dollars into green energy that is still not nearly as efficient as fossil fuels, that the Earth will be saved from some doomsday scenario?  On the flip side, How are do you sit there and flat out deny scientific consensus?  Well, it&#39;s simple most people aren&#39;t climate scientists which is fine.  The thing is doomsday scenarios may be the most exciting way to engage public interest, but it is extremely toxic.  Yes, there is a scientific consensus that we are speeding up climate change, but the &quot;no turning back point&quot; is very much up for debate.  We have had the worst weather in decades but it&#39;s still not &quot;the worst weather&quot; we have had.  The drought in the 1930&#39;s is a good example. So using natural disasters to create fear and drive politics is highly immoral.</p>

<p>I think the back and forth about weather severity and what it means is beside the point.  We need to sell people on what is more tangible and what they can understand....which is $$$$$$$$.  In reality regardless, of what you believe, it is pretty obvious that a future with renewable energy is a much brighter one.  I love this video about the third industrial revolution <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QX3M8Ka9vUA</a>.  The thing is switching over to renewable energy and redoing our energy infrastructure will create so many jobs.  On top of that, you don&#39;t want to be the country playing catch-up.  Why on Earth would we not want to be at the forefront of renewable technology when the trend starts completely switching in that direction.  Like many things in politics, we have just ended up talking past each other.  Let&#39;s stop arguing about something that no one actually understands, and start talking about how green technology is going to become one of the largest industries in our future.  Right now innovation is being halted by rhetoric, and scientists need to stop using politics to advertise untenable predictions and start showing why everyone should be stoked about a clean future.  </p>

I also admit that it was a mistake on my part to use the words &quot;manufacture consent&quot; in my post title.</p>

<p>This CMV post is <strong>not</strong> a discussion on whether or not you believe that climate change is a hoax. This CMV post is also <strong>not</strong> a discussion on the accuracy or validity of research into climate change.</p>

<p>This CMV <strong>is</strong> about the backfiring of <em>The Conversation</em>&#39;s decision to ban climate change denialism on their platform. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you believe that climate change is real and every bit as bad as <em>The Conversation</em> says it is, then banning climate change denial backfired because instead of preventing misinformation, it is instead inflaming climate change deniers by giving them a reason to complain of persecution.</li>
<li>If you believe that climate change is a hoax (or is completely natural) and that <em>The Conversation</em> is stomping on your right to freedom of thought by banning banning climate change denial, then their action backfired because it helps strengthen your argument that academia and media are conspiring against you.</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, I am not a climate change denier myself. However, I now think that perhaps banning climate change denial on a media outlet will achieve the exact opposite of its goal.</p>

Many of the comments absolutely tore this man apart for &quot;throwing money down the gutter&quot;. This really set me off.</p>

<p>Essentially my view is that not only is investing in renewable energy very important, it is also THE most important thing the government can spend money on. In my own state a recent proposal was made to increase renewable energy to 25% by 2025 and it was shot down. This was extremely disappointing</p>

<p>I understand that a balanced budget is important, but I believe the threat of global warming (among other environmental problems) supersedes other expenses such as national defense. What is more important than the future of the planet?</p>

t3_7qkll1	CMV: If climate change causes widespread death then climate change deniers should be tried in court for crimes against humanity	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>There are some reasonable predictions that climate change could result in widespread human death, as well as mass extinction of other species. We are already seeing grave signs of our oceans being at risk for massive negative changes. </p>

<p>If that does happen, then climate change deniers should be held responsible for crimes against humanity. Wikipedia defines crimes against humanity as &quot;certain acts that are deliberately committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack or individual attack directed against any civilian or an identifiable part of a civilian population.  Unlike war crimes, crimes against humanity can be committed during peace or war. They are not isolated or sporadic events, but are part either of a government policy (although the perpetrators need not identify themselves with this policy) or of a wide practice of atrocities tolerated or condoned by a government or a de facto authority.&quot;</p>

<p>One could argue that the consequences of climate change were not deliberate but there has been plenty of warning by trained scientists for people to be aware of the risk and for a non-scientist to take a stance in opposition is grossly irresponsible.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not interested in discussing the premise that widespread death might not happen. My argument is that when and <em>if</em> it happens, people should be held responsible.</p>

<p>EDIT: Like most crimes against humanity, we would be targeting leaders. People of influence or in powerful positions, especially politicians. Although I think the average Joe does hold some responsibility, it might help to compare this to WWII. We didn&#39;t put every German person on trial, although many Germans certainly were somewhat responsible for going along with what the leaders were asking for.</p>

t3_e0nlwp	CMV: Oil companies like Exxon and BP should not be treated like a scapegoat in climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I agree that they are a link in the chain to climate change, and that oil spills are inexcusable and worthy of massive fines. However regarding their role in green house gas climate change, their primary role is to move oil from the ground to the gas pump, electric utility, and to the plastics factory. Although there is some combustion in this process, the vast majority of combustion occurs by the customer. </p>

<p>The customer is ultimately the one who chooses to purchase and combust the fuel, which releases the green house gas. BP is none the wiser whether 1 gallon of fuel sold is used in a 50 MPG prius with 4 occupants, or its used by a lone occupant of an 8 MPG behemoth driving to his 9-5 office job (about 24 times more fuel used per person). Exxon probably keeps track of the efficiency of the utilities who burn their natural gas at power plants, but the utility and Exxon has no idea whether a resident is using electricity to power a high efficiency air conditioner in a well insulated home, or to power a spare freezer that has a faulty compressor and is left cracked open half the time.</p>

<p>Lets say Exxon, BP, Shell and others all disappeared tonight. Sure there would be major disruptions in supplies, and fuel consumption would drop significantly in the short term. But the demand is still very high. There is certainly no shortage of capital waiting for deployment and people looking to make a buck. Oil production would ramp back up very rapidly. </p>

<p>I guess I&#39;m not sure what to propose as policy changes. Maybe we refocus our energy away from oil producers and redirect it towards reducing fuel demand. Maybe we can make tools for simplifying carbon footprint tracking. Perhaps by applying more pressure on our local and federal governments for stronger incentives/credits for high efficiency machines (vehicles, air conditioners, etc). Maybe we can think more creatively about these incentives. What if we credited homeowners for setting their thermostats more conservatively?</p>

<p>Edit: Thanks for the comments all. I definitely learned some things and appreciate this respectful forum for discussion. Big oil companies have been nastier than I previously thought. I&#39;d be more willing to support larger fines/penalties against them for misleading the public. I&#39;d continue to support larger fuel/oil taxes across all producers.</p>

t3_6fxaf2	"CMV: Pressuring people to adopt a lower standard of living (e.g. reduce beef consumption, switch to an electric car, change light bulbs, etc.) causes people to reject climate change and will doom us all."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Okay, so, I&#39;ve been getting into the whole climate change business for the past couple of weeks -- I&#39;ve done some cursory research on the matter, watched Before The Flood and Earth 2100 (don&#39;t watch that last one if you don&#39;t want to be depressed or cry), and honestly I&#39;m starting to understand why it is so many people reject the postulates that climate change is happening and that it&#39;s largely caused by our lifestyles. The reason why is because of the &quot;solutions&quot; the climate change movement&#39;s been pushing for. I&#39;m talking things like telling individuals to give up their gas-guzzling SUVs, to reduce/eliminate consumption of beef or rice, turn up their air conditioners in the summer or turn down their heaters in the winter, stupid stuff like that. These &quot;solutions&quot; are stupid and unfair for a multitude of reasons, especially if you&#39;re poor. Carbon taxes are also dumb largely for the same reasons these &quot;solutions&quot; are dumb, but in some ways carbon taxes are a lot worse. I&#39;ll make a list:</p>

<p>Individual lifestyle changes to combat climate change are stupid because:</p>

<ul>
<li>They lower the standard of living for everyone who adopts them. </li>
</ul>

<p>Look, coal, oil and gas are cheap. We have to accept that. Renewables are coming a long way but they&#39;re still not fully there yet. And coal, oil and gas make the comfortable lifestyle in the developed world with plentiful access to otherwise expensive and rare food and cheap transportation possible. American cities simply aren&#39;t designed around being green yet and people still have to drive many miles to work and back, and most Americans can&#39;t afford electric cars -- they still have to use gas to get to the jobs they need to go to to survive, and to tell them they should drive less which would impact their ability to do that is just wrong. People have a right to each as much beef as they want, to drive around as much as they want, to have living conditions that are comfortable for them (e.g. heat and air conditioning) and demanding that people give up these things to lower their energy consumption is unfair, especially if you&#39;re poor. Our meat industry is designed the way it is because burgers have to cost a dollar for the economy to be stable, and poor people need burgers to cost a dollar so they have cheap and ready access to protein. Beef is delicious, it goes with pretty much everything, it&#39;s an enjoyable part of life for most people especially Americans, and it&#39;s a food source people have a right to regardless of how inefficient you argue it is. All of the arguments people make against beef apply just as much so to rice and rice is an integral part of Asian culture just as beef is to American culture; you don&#39;t have a right to tell hundreds of millions of people that they don&#39;t have the right to have access to the foods they love because our agriculture systems harm the environment. Having reduced access to the foods we love and I honestly argue need to survive directly harms our standard of living and our way of life and if the climate change movement wants to succeed, it has to stop arguing that people need to adopt a lowered standard of living and instead push for things that allow us to stop global warming while driving around as much as we want and eating whatever we want.</p>

<ul>
<li>Most people can&#39;t afford to adopt a greener lifestyle or to pay carbon taxes</li>
</ul>

<p>And this is mainly the reason why I feel the way I do above. Look, most of the world is extremely impoverished. Even most Americans are very impoverished and have a hard time paying rent or getting food or meeting their basic needs. Being forced to adopt a lower standard of living to stop climate change will just make life harder and more expensive for them. Especially for carbon taxes -- let&#39;s be real here, the biggest companies in the world can afford to pay carbon taxes without having to change their behaviors or reduce their emissions in the slightest, and you know what they&#39;re all gonna do? Pass on those taxes to the consumer. And before you know it, food and gas prices will go up, making it even harder for poor people to make ends meet and widening the inequality gap even further. Poor people are literally the only ones that would be negatively affected by stuff like enforced lifestyle changes or carbon taxes and the like. They&#39;re just as dumb and as much of an infringement on our rights to consume legal products as cigarette and soda taxes are. We don&#39;t have a right to make the poor suffer like that.</p>

<ul>
<li>The developing world has a right to an American lifestyle, too, and the climate change movement will stop them from having it if done wrong</li>
</ul>

<p>All of the stuff I talk about above applies a hundred-fold to the developing world, especially China and India who are experiencing their own industrial revolutions and bringing their people out of poverty through cheap energy sources like coal, oil and gas. It should be pretty self-evident to anyone that it&#39;s completely unfair to deny them the same kind of lifestyle the west was able to enjoy for over a century because of our use of fossil fuels. You know over 300 million people in India don&#39;t even have electricity? Are you <em>really</em> going to tell over 2 billion people they don&#39;t have a right to switch over to a meat-based diet. Climate change advocates often argue that we&#39;d need 4 earths to support everyone in the world living a lifestyle the way Americans do -- why not use all of those neat and hefty renewables, green technology, build carbon/methane scrubbers, get rid of corn subsidies which are largely the real reason why the U.S. meat industry sucks so bad and make the fucking cows eat grass the way they&#39;re supposed to instead so we all actually <em>can</em> have that lifestyle that we have a right to?</p>

<ul>
<li>There&#39;s no guarantee individual lifestyle changes will have any meaningful impact</li>
</ul>

<p>Specifically because of India and China. Their energy usage is accelerating and telling everyone else in the world they have to reduce their consumption while the developing world negates their hard work is just not gonna work. We need solutions that span worldwide and are fair for everyone.</p>

<ul>
<li>There are better solutions to climate change than shitty carbon taxes or lowering our standard of living. Some no one even bothered to consider yet</li>
</ul>

<p>And those solutions largely revolve around switching to renewables. Here&#39;s an idea: how about instead of guilt-tripping, shaming and emotionally manipulating people into giving up their SUVs, why not give people subsidies and have trade-in programs so they can trade in their SUVs for a nice Tesla or a Nissan Leaf?  Or remove corn subsidies and put that subsidy money toward greening the American lifestyle so we can do and eat what we want while helping the environment? Removing the corn subsidy and regulating the meat industry would do a LOT for this while ensuring people&#39;s access to beef -- by not letting them feed cows corn and candy anymore, cows&#39; digestive systems would no longer be as negatively impacted reducing occurrences of shit like e. coli and mad cow disease, and by using the former corn subsidy to fund green shit like CO2/methane scrubbers (they&#39;re coming along, fund them the way we do renewables), we can reduce or remove the methane the cows put into the air so we can have our beef and not have to worry about whether we&#39;re causing global warming or not. Or redistribute the trillions of dollars in tax revenue we already get every year away from stupid shit like the military (we don&#39;t need to waste our money making Haliburton richer) or even shitty medicare (replace it with single-payer; it&#39;s cheaper anyway and doesn&#39;t suck nearly as badly) and use <em>that</em> money to fund a transition to a green economy. Use that money to move us away from buying wheat and produce from big bulky monoculture farms in Buttfuck, Ohio and let cities grow their own shit in their own greenhouse skyscapers so they can grow and eat whatever the fuck they want, whenever the fuck they want it and be able to use electric for shipping. Get the oil industry involved too; let them get a piece of the renewable pie so they can transition to making solar panels instead of fracking for oil so they&#39;ll stop pushing their shitty anti-climate propaganda campaigns, which they&#39;re only doing because they know climate change will cost them their businesses and livelihoods. Why not help them change instead of pushing them away or destroying them?</p>

<p>Fundamentally if the climate change movement wants to succeed it has to push for renewables, carbon/methane scrubbers, and other technology to undo the effects of global warming while allowing the rest of us to maintain our lifestyles and standards of living and allowing the rest of the developing world to get out of poverty and to have that same lifestyle which they fundamentally have a right to. Instead of telling people they have to adopt a lowered standard of living or reduce their energy usage.</p>

<p>I think it should be pretty self-evident why pressuring people to adopt lifestyle changes makes them reject climate change. Put yourself in their shoes for five seconds and honestly ask yourself if you would listen if you were told you had to give up the thing you loved most in the world to save the environment -- of course you wouldn&#39;t, and I wouldn&#39;t blame you. It&#39;s just dumb. So, so goddamn dumb.</p>

<p>TL;DR  The green movement is fucking up efforts to stop global warming by pushing individuals to adopt a lower standard of living -- their solutions will deny India and China the means to continue their industrial revolutions, will destroy the middle class in the U.S. and drive income inequality even further, doing that is unnecessary as there are better ways to combat global warming that don&#39;t involve adopting a lower standard of living, there&#39;s more that needs to be done to protect the biosphere they&#39;re not advocating for or trying to do at all, and they&#39;ll fail as long as they keep pushing for this.</p>

<p>I am not a scientist, so I do not rub shoulders with the supporters of this theory frequently. I would love to hear from anyone out there who studies the climate and believes in global warming/climate change why you believe what you do, and better yet, the scientific evidence that you base your argument on.</p>

They always fail to mention that running mostly on solar, wind and hydropower is currently impossible for most of the world. </p>

<p>In Germany carbon emissions actually increased after a large increase in renewable energy. Advocates for renewables often point to efficiency increases as if somehow that would enable them to completely replace other sources of energy without ever mentioning the enormous subsidies that fueled those advances. Recently in the US ten times the amount was spent on renewable subsidies per watt of energy produced as fossil fuels. Any future innovations in renewables are also competing with future advances in non renewables. Renewables also cannot be stored effectively which causes major problems when they comprise a large portion of electricity production.</p>

<p>I think a much more achievable solution would be to use more natural gas as it burns much more efficiently than other sources of energy and using more nuclear power which has been incredibly successful in France.</p>

t3_5e9fmw	CMV: Why focus so much on climate change? Global warming is next to impossible to reverse.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Everyone seems so fixed on Donald Trump looking to purge some of the anti-global warming aspects in our country like getting rid of clean energy laws, thinking it will lead to the end of the world. Hasn&#39;t global warming been happening since the ice age? Do we really think the incredibly minuscule amounts of &quot;environmental control&quot; will somehow change our fate of a global warming crisis? The 1% gets rich from oil and gas so do we honestly believe we can sway their minds to go to electric vehicles? I feel like everyone should stop fixating on global warming as it is inevitable, and the only REAL change will happen when we reach the tipping point of a possibility of human extinction. We can help the environment with stopping deforestation and wildlife preservation, but nothing can stop global warming unless there is a collective effort worldwide to stop a contemporary mass extinction.</p>

t3_4ildc4	CMV: Climate Change is not Man Made.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have been questioning constantly constantly the fact of climate change and I can see it is happening a lot recently because of the record high temperatures of the past couple of years. The only problem is that the issue has become too polluted with politics and the truth behind it has been obscured by those in political power. In the mid-1900&#39;s or so there was a global cooling period where scientists went crazy over it and said we would have to put coal dust over the ice caps to prevent an ice age that would wipe us out. I hear a lot of the same stuff today with how our oceans will wipe out entire cities and destroy countries. We don&#39;t even know for sure why the climate is changing and we make these huge assumptions that this is your fault.</p>

t3_5wq1id	CMV: Inability to quantify the impact of humans on climate is a real problem for proponents of man-made climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Today I came across an interview of Bill Nye the Science Guy on Tucker Carlson&#39;s Fox News show. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZsccoSAkUI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=17"">Here is a link to the video of the interview</a>. It&#39;s about nine minutes long.</p>

<p>I like Bill Nye, and I generally am inclined to believe that man-made climate change is real. But the interview put a finger on something that has bothered me for a while. I have never heard a clear answer to how warm the earth would be without man&#39;s involvement. I have also never heard the difference that humans make quantified in a definite way.</p>

<p>I see two possibilities, neither of which is appealing:</p>

<p>1 - Is climate science so inaccurate that we do not have answers to these questions? If so, does that call the concept of Global Warming into question?</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>2 - Are opponents of legitimate climate science so effective that they have successfully created doubt about something that is materially a fact, thus creating large risks for the entire world ecosystem and economy?</p>

<p>I&#39;m looking to climate research for a statement along the lines of &quot;The earth is, on average, 5 degrees +/- 2 degrees warmer due to human activity than it should be.&quot;  OR an explanation of why we don&#39;t need a statement like that for global warming advocates to be credible.</p>

t3_35tsu6	CMV: Believing that free trade is bad despite near universal consensus among economists that it's beneficial is no different than believing that climate change isn't real despite near universal consensus among client scientists that it is.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Free trade yields positive results for every country involved, and this is an established economic fact. Consumers in richer countries get to purchase goods at lower prices (which raises their standard of living) while poorer countries get capital investments and higher incomes (which raises their standard of living). Personally, I like that I can wake up, sip my Costa Rican coffee as I sit on my Swedish furniture and watch my Japanese TV before checking my Korean phone and getting in my German car to go to work for an American company that gets 90% of its revenue from overseas. If those goods all had to be made in America, they would probably be of lower quality because global competition is unequivocally good for consumers.</p>

<p>Despite this, &quot;free trade&quot; is still a controversial political topic. Reddit&#39;s two most popular politicians, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have both promised to help stop jobs from being shipped overseas and have both been very critical of NAFTA, claiming that it has hurt America and has cost it hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, actual <a href=""http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/effects-of-nafta-on-us-employment-and-policy-responses_5k9ffbqlvk0r-en?crawler=true"">peer-reviewed analysis</a> that studied NAFTA after it was implemented suggested it had a negligible impact on American jobs (and a paper by Matusz suggested it had a very small but positive impact).</p>

<p>If a person doesn&#39;t believe in evolution or climate change despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then they are being anti-science. And I believe that if you think free trade is a net negative despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then you&#39;re being anti-science. </p>

<p>So, CMV and explain why free trade is a bad thing. </p>

t3_5irmi8	CMV: Climate change isn't something 99% of the population should worry about because the ingenuity of the other 1% will fix it in 50-100 years	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>The title is basically my reasoning. Progress advances quickest when the stakes are at their highest, as we can see with the space race of the 60s and the development of miltary technologies during both World Wars. If and when climate change gets so bad that we have to do something to stop it, I have no doubt that humans will rise to challenge and create an artificial super-tree, or a cooling agent, that can reverse climate change in a relatively short amount of time. It might be expensive at first, but when survival of a coastal city like New Orleans or even New York is massively at stake, a price even in the billions of dollars will be paid. I&#39;m not saying that we should all burn as many fossil fuels as possible in the meantime, but I do think that worrying about it if you are a regular citizen is just silly.</p>

t3_2a2wgs	"CMV: Saying ""Global warming is real and we're causing it"" is vacuous and deceptive."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>&quot;Global warming is real.&quot; treats global warming as a thing that either exists or doesn&#39;t exist. This is how 4 year-olds think about the Boogie Man. If he&#39;s real, we&#39;re in trouble. (Remember South Park&#39;s ManBearPig?)</p>

<p>A more appropriate way of putting &quot;Global warming is real&quot; is &quot;The globe is warming.&quot; After all, when we observe that fewer people have jobs than before, we don&#39;t say &quot;unemployment rise is real,&quot; we say &quot;unemployment is rising.&quot; I suspect the reason climate activists prefer &quot;Global warming is real.&quot; to &quot;The globe is warming.&quot; is because the former makes people scream &quot;AAAHHH&quot; while the latter makes people wonder &quot;How much? How quickly?&quot; And the answer -
~1.5F over the past 100 years - does not sound like a crisis. </p>

<p>&quot;...and we&#39;re causing it.&quot; Implicit in this claim is the idea that a rise in global temperature must have some discernable cause. When climate activists say things like this, they talk as if it is natural for global termperature to remain constant. The mere fact that the globe is warming is presented as a sign that something has gone wrong with the planet (e.g. The Earth &quot;has a fever,&quot; as some like to put it.), and we can determine what caused to problem like a doctor identifies diseases based on syptoms. </p>

<p>But the fact, as I understand it, is that there&#39;s no compelling reason to think that 1.5F of warming over 100 years is anything other than the climate just doing its thing. If anyone wants to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hockey_stick_controversy#National_Research_Council_Report"">play hockey</a> in a comment thread, I&#39;m down. Global temperature change is not an abnormality that demands an explanation. Rather, it&#39;s just a result of chaos in the climate system.</p>

<p>The only defensible meaning of &quot;we&#39;re causing it&quot; is &quot;we&#39;re causing the globe to be warmer than it otherwise would have been had we not burned so much fuel and cut down so many trees.&quot; Again, the more accurate way of putting things is <em>explicitly quantitative,</em> which leads people to follow-up and ask &quot;By how much?&quot; Scientific organizations like the IPCC have basically said that humans have caused <em>most</em> of the warming since ~1950, meaning we&#39;ve caused somewhere between 0.5 and 1.0 F of warming over about 64 years. I suspect that climate activists want to conceal this from the public in order to give it a much more troubling sense of what the &quot;consensus&quot; is.</p>

<p>So, I think the statements like &quot;Global warming is real and we&#39;re causing it.&quot; are intended to frame the issue in a non-quantitative way, since the numbers aren&#39;t on climate activists&#39; side. </p>

<p>Feel free to challenge me from either a linguistic, political, or scientific angle.  </p>

<p><em>P.S.</em> I understand that there are plenty of more substantive scientific claims being made by climate activists like James Hansen, about how maybe some of the heat trapped by human-emitted CO2 is now being sunk into the deep oceans and so on, but what I&#39;m really taking issue with here is the exaggerated and grossly oversimplified rhetoric presented to the general public during political discussions like those you&#39;ll see on news channels.</p>

t3_d29khb	"CMV : Climate change, it's time to change the way we live"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have lived in the US for one month, as I am here as an exchange student for one semester. This country offers a lot of opportunities, and I like it so much.</p>

<p>But I am really wondering about the way of life here. On the one hand, as a french guy, I noticed differences in cultures, which are really exciting and I really enjoy my trip here. But on the other hand, I realized that there is a huge gap between our ways of life and yours, in terms of consumption, car use, bike use, public transport, recycling etc...</p>

<p>In Europe, I have been aware that we consume too much and too fast for a lot of years, that we should reduce our impact on the planet. But here I just realized that this way of life in the US has probably an even greater impact on the planet.</p>

<p>I know also that a lot of people here are fighting for a more responsible way of life. But I still think that this is not acceptable to see so much cars on streets, so much students with their own cars, empty buses, inefficient recycling, use of the AC day and night etc... I really think that we have the opportunity to change. </p>

I feel like, as a result of the existence of this group of people, we are not allowed to question any aspect of climate change without being labelled a denier, and this means less-conclusive aspects of climate change are more widely accepted than they should be. </p>

<p>This is on my mind because Bill Nye recently said that <a href=""http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2014/05/07/crossfire_bill_nye_vs_se_cupp_on_climate_change_scare_tactics.html"">&quot;Climate change is our most urgent #1 priority right now&quot;</a>. I disagree - I think it&#39;s an issue, but it&#39;s not a catastrophic issue.</p>

<hr/>

<p><strong>Here are the things that I accept to be true or highly likely:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Humans have raised the global temperature about one degree over the natural average because we&#39;ve been burning fossil fuels and otherwise releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.</p></li>
<li><p>Sea level will rise a couple meters in the next century, which will damage property.</p></li>
<li><p>Climates will change in semi-predictable ways; some areas will get drier, most areas will get hotter, most areas will get wetter. Arable land will shift.</p></li>
<li><p>Ecosystems will change in response. Some species will decline, others will rise (a lot of things we don&#39;t like, like bugs, but also some species we do like)</p></li>
<li><p>Storms will be stronger and more damaging.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And here are the things I find to be questionable. I would like someone to let me know why these &quot;alarmist&quot; view might be accurate.</strong></p>

<p>I&#39;ve ordered these from &quot;most ridiculous&quot; (in my opinion, obviously) to &quot;least ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Earth will become Venus 2.0 if we don&#39;t slow down greenhouse gas missions. (Bill Nye came to speak at my school and he mentioned this as a possibility. I haven&#39;t found anything suggesting this is actually possible. We don&#39;t have enough fossil fuels to burn.)</p></li>
<li><p>Large swaths of land will be submerged. Like Florida! (I haven&#39;t seen any actual climate scientists suggest a sea level rise over a couple meters in the next hundred years. This sentiment of large areas being submerged seems to stem from the maps that show what the Earth would look like if all the glaciers melted. But all the glaciers aren&#39;t going to melt. The Antarctic glacier is staying put. Also, I hate when they show videos of glaciers calving in the news like that&#39;s evidence that the glaciers are shrinking. I mean, the glaciers are shrinking, but glacial calving doesn&#39;t prove anything; glaciers do that even if they&#39;re growing. Anyway, it seems like the rate of rising sea level will be slow enough that we can adapt naturally over time.)</p></li>
<li><p>Climate change will lead to political collapse. (This is just a baseless conjecture.)</p></li>
<li><p>We&#39;re ruining this planet for future generations! (Eh, sort of, but not terribly so. Not irreparably so. I hear people say that we need to start colonizing other planets because we&#39;re ruining this one, but have you seen the other planets?! They suck so much worse than here. Earth is gonna be fine. We might make it a little more difficult to support our huge population here, but future generations will manage okay.)</p></li>
<li><p>A huge proportion of the world population will starve because of changing climates and crop failure. (I feel like we can adapt to shifting climates because it won&#39;t be instant. Also, our crops our getting better, and they&#39;ll probably be able to feed more people in the future than they can now.)</p></li>
<li><p>But the polar bears are dying! (Sucks for the polar bears, but I really don&#39;t care enough about them to support massive expensive efforts to combat global warming for them alone.) </p></li>
</ul>

<p>Essentially, I think climate change sucks, but not so much so that it needs to be the top priority.</p>

<p><strong>And lastly, some potential positive effects of climate change that I feel are dismissed too early by people who only want to argue the negative effects of climate change:</strong></p>

<p>Nobody really wants to grant climate change deniers any positive effects of climate change, because that would give them grounds for their stance of inaction. I feel like these are possibilities, though. Take any of these that are not accurate and let me know why:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>In the long run, we will be able to grow more crops. (Longer growing season, although the good places to grow crops will move.)</p></li>
<li><p>In the long run, we will have fewer deserts. (Higher global temperatures generally means more rain.)</p></li>
<li><p>Based on Milankovitch cycles, we should start dipping into an ice age over the next thousand years, and colder temperatures would be worse than warmer temperatures. We&#39;re actually cancelling that, for now.</p></li>
<li><p>We can&#39;t warm the Earth too much more than we already have because our supply of fossil fuels is running out. (Okay, this isn&#39;t a positive thing at all. But it greatly reduces the potential impact of climate change. I&#39;ve seen estimates that we might run out of economically viable oil in 40 years! We can&#39;t emit much carbon dioxide if we can&#39;t burn fossil fuels anymore.)</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I really would appreciate someone more well-informed than me to correct any incorrect assertions. And if there&#39;s something important I didn&#39;t mention, feel free to bring that up, too.</p>

t3_5zb8bk	CMV: Globalism is necessary to combat climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Tomorrow I have to vote. As someone living below sea level and alarmed with studies predicting that there will be no land suitible for wheat in Africa at 2080 (Fisher), good environmental policies are a major factor influencing my vote. There are only two parties that have leading environmental policy in their party program. An important difference between the two is their attitude against european integration and international trade. One sees european and international cooperation as essential for preserving our current biosphere, under conditions such as transparancy and testing the policies for environmental and social impact. The other is against increased european cooperation and supports pro-exit policies, as well has a harsher stance towards international trade cooperation.</p>

<p>To me it made more sense that increased integration with other countries would be most effective for restoring our balance with the biosphere. Climate change comes with high regional variability and will impact different countries in different ways. While most will be negatively affected, some at higher lattitudes, like Russia, may see an increase in arable land for instance. Only when their economy is integrated with the rest of the world and therefore their standard of living is dependent on the rest of the world also being well off, will they care enough to use their enormous potential in combating climate change (Kotilainen for more on this). So only when caring for others is the same as caring for yourself will enviromental policies be implemented fast enough to stop the most disastrous effects of climate change. Increased cooperation economically could also help facilitate the cooperation necessary for fair world wide policies that are needed to combat climate change. </p>

<p>Disclaimer: I am not certain about voting for either of these parties and I care about other parts of their program too, this question is more about a debate between environmentalists that has not yet been resolved (or mentioned here before), even though it seems quite important. I also assume a few things, such as countries acting quite egoistic. I am also not informed about for instance the impact of globalism currently compared to a world where countries would be more closed off. It seems like that topic leaves a bit too much space for speculation and is maybe better for a seperate discussion (will Trump bringing back factories to the states, if it works, mean more mechanized and perhaps therefore more energy intensive industry? Or will this effect be negated by overall economic downturn as a consequence, or is it the other way?).</p>

<p>I assume cooperation is a non zero sum game, while climate change is?</p>

t3_ah0gv5	CMV: The debate about climate change is only muddled by scientific data such as carbon emissions and ice cap erosion. A much more effective argument is just using relatable common sense.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I’m not one to claim scientists and their data are corrupt, inaccurate, or politically motivated. I just think using this data as the argument allows those against the idea of climate change to find even the most minuscule data that conflicts with it. In an argument to try to convince someone of climate change I think it’s much more effective to point out general common sense ideas:
1. Humans create waste that is dumped into the earth in garbage dumps and landfills. This waste affects the earth negatively, mostly with plastics and certain toxic liquids that contaminate the earth. As long as the dumping continues the contamination continues. No one can reasonably deny this.
2. Humans create waste that is dumped into natural water sources such as lakes and oceans. This waste affects the water negatively, mostly with plastics and certain toxic liquids that contaminate the water. As long as the dumping continues the contamination continues. No one can reasonably deny this.
3. Using items 1 and 2, a relatable common sense hypothesis can be determined that humans create waste that emits into the air/atmosphere and that the waste negatively affects and contaminates the air, and the contamination will continue as long as the waste continues to be emitted.
4. Contamination of the earth, water, and air is a negligent, irresponsible, and harmful act of humankind.
5. Government regulation is a reasonable and necessary action towards citizens and companies to reduce contamination, considering people and companies have demonstrated they will not effectively reduce contamination without such regulations.</p>

<p>These 5 points are the most effective foundation of an argument convincing people that people have contributed to climate change and need to act to reduce climate change. Talking about ocean levels and percentages of degree shifts, and carbon emissions are ineffective.</p>

t3_20trai	Humans should embrace global warming. CMV	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A recent report by American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) (<a href=""http://whatweknow.aaas.org/"">http://whatweknow.aaas.org/</a>) says that the scientific consensus is that global warming/climate change is real. However, I don&#39;t think the negative impact of climate change is that big of a deal to humans and for that matter the rest of the planet. </p>

<p>Sure, there may be higher sea levels than before, but we are capable of moving inland if needed. The infrastructure transition will be a boon for the global economy.</p>

<p>Some plant and animal species may be affected negatively, but others may be affected positively. Moreover, it is better to live in a warm climate than a cold one.</p>

<p>The threat of extreme weather events however has still not been proven to be linked to global warming.</p>

<p>If people have to move, then so be it. We can handle it over the course of hundreds of years.</p>

<p>Unlike, the depletion of the Ozone Layer, global warming doesn&#39;t let in harmful solar radiation. In some cases, it even blocks it.</p>

<p>The alarm over climate change/global warming is over-hyped as a threat to mankind and the planet. We should embrace it or at least not go crazy in trying to stop it.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Lately, I&#39;ve been reading up on the work of a man named <a href=""http://guymcpherson.com/"">Guy McPherson</a>, who is of the opinion that global warming will drive humanity to extinction within a few decades. The global temperature is increasing wildly, and in a few years many heavily populated areas will exceed &quot;wet bulb&quot; temperature, meaning they will become so hot that it would be impossible for human life to exist there. These areas would include much of the eastern and south-eastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization, and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly don&#39;t know much about climate science, and I&#39;m hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this, but from what I&#39;ve read, it seems fairly solid.</p>

<p>Even the US Navy has predicted an ice-free arctic by 2016, which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate.</p>

<p>I would really, really like my view on this changed.</p>

t3_axxzu5	CMV: Extreme climate change is inevitable	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I think that random people are completely powerless when it comes to climate change.
The most important people in the world will be the last to get seriously affected so they aren&#39;t going to do anything until it&#39;s literally unbearable.</p>

<p>Also saying that &quot;we can form groups and protest&quot; is useless too as people are ignorant and depressed so they won&#39;t do anything. Majority won&#39;t care at all, the small part that cares won&#39;t take action and the remaining part is too small to do anything.</p>

<p>So our pretty much only option is to wait and see what happens, then try our best to adapt and hopefully not die...</p>

<p>It&#39;s pretty depressing, can anybody show me other options? </p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_540w4e	"CMV: Human population reaching Earth's maximum carrying capacity is a far more pressing, serious concern than climate change."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Let me be clear before I begin:  <strong>I am not a climate change denier</strong>.  Climate change is real, has anthropogenic origins, and can have serious, irreversible consequences.  I&#39;m simply debating that it&#39;s less serious than human overpopulation as a cause of problems for humankind.</p>

<p>Also...yes, climate change is exacerbated (and could be considered to be caused) by human overpopulation.  The point I&#39;m making is instead that the <em>aggregate of other environmental/societal issues that are directly caused by human overpopulation</em> exceeds the issues that are caused by rising levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.  Technically you could lump them together, but in terms of the solutions to both of the problems, they&#39;re vastly different, so I&#39;d like to separate them.</p>

<hr/>

<p>According to the IPCC&#39;s AR5 report, sea level rise is expected in the absolute worst case to reach 0.82 meters (worst case scenario mean being 0.63) by 2100.  Looking at a <a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/"">sea level rise map</a>, a ~1 meter rise barely impacts geography at all.  Far from the cries of mass exoduses from coastal regions, it seems that we have hundreds of years before most people have to worry about any meaningful climate change refugee crises.  When sea level rise does happen it&#39;s over hundreds of years, even given rapid increases in CO2 in the atmosphere.</p>

<p>With most of the risks climate change poses, I see more pressing ones caused by overpopulation.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Vanishing biodiversity is caused by climate change, but the key cause of extinctions today isn&#39;t ocean acidification or rising temperatures, but rather <a href=""https://www.fws.gov/habitat/"">destruction, degradation, and fragmentation of habitat</a></p></li>
<li><p>Sea level rise will cause some people to have to move from coastal regions, but...looking at a <a href=""http://geology.com/sea-level-rise/"">sea level rise map</a>, and look at the effects of +1m rise -- an unrealistically pessimistic amount, since sea level is expected to rise about 0.63 meters in the worst case scenario <a href=""http://ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/syr/SYR_AR5_FINAL_full_wcover.pdf"">according to the IPCC</a> (see page 60) -- barely any area is actually threatened, even if you look at at-risk areas such as bangladesh.  Compare that to refugee crises due to food shortages, droughts, and other overpopulation-caused crises.  Currently, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/04/climate-change-population-crisis-paris-summit"">40% of land on Earth is used to produce food</a>.  What happens when we go higher?  Even if we wipe out all land habitat on earth to make room for grain fields, we would only barely support another century or so of population growth before we exceed that too.</p></li>
<li><p>In terms of health risks, compare increased risk of heatstroke and heat-related illnesses that are expected due to climate change to mass starvation and water shortages in the event humans exceed the earth&#39;s carrying capacity.</p></li>
<li><p>Fish shortages will be likely caused not be shrinking fish populations because of ocean acidification and temperature changes, but rather due to overfishing because the growing population needs more food.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>This isn&#39;t even mentioning pollution from increased industrial farming contaminating groundwater sources, wars over scarce resources in places like Africa, and urban intensification causing social issues.</p>

<p>I think it&#39;s much more important to look at curbing human population growth than it is to try to look at one of the minor, long-term symptoms it might lead to.</p>

To further clarify where I&#39;m at, I don&#39;t have a stance that we <em>should</em> give up, I just feel at this point all the climate news I&#39;m told is hopeless. Maybe this hopelessness is just attempts to catch the public eye so we&#39;ll finally do something. I don&#39;t know, so any view changing info would be more than welcome. Thanks!</p>

t3_5hnd15	CMV: Trying to change the population's carbon footprint is less efficient than changing industry practices to combat climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;d like to preface this by saying that my opinion comes from my gut feeling about the subject. I haven&#39;t read a lot about the subject so I think my view could easily be changed.</p>

<p>I think that from the perspective of combatting climate change, it is more efficient (in terms of money and time invested) to change industry practices rather than trying to change the little everyday actions that an individual can do to fight climate change.</p>

<p>I believe that any of the changes that could be promoted to individuals are either too small and won&#39;t have a significant impact or the changes are too big and won&#39;t get adopted by a significant part of the population. Therefore, money and time invested in promoting &quot;best practices for the environment&quot; to the population is money wasted.</p>

<p>Introducing regulations and laws that target industry practices is the best way to reduce our carbon output because industries use far more resources than individuals. Reducing plastic use in packaging, reducing the number of power plants using dirty fuels and other similar changes will affect the environment a lot more than whatever actions could be reasonably changed in the general population.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not saying that money and time spent towards sensitizing the population towards the environment is a bad thing, just that the focus should be on companies changing their behavior and not the population. I think the focus should shift from &quot;individuals should do more to save the environment&quot; to &quot;companies should do more to change the environment&quot;.</p>

t3_695ftc	CMV:Global climate change is the most important threat today to global biological diversity	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I believe ecosystems are already showing the negative impacts of climate change which will only get worse as time goes on. Rapid climate change affects ecosystems and species ability to adapt and so biodiversity loss increases. Some important examples include loss of sea ice with the possibility of ice-free summers causing the loss of species adapted to life with ice as well as loss of ocean ecosystems (mangroves, coral reefs) and tundra. Fundamental processes of the ocean are being changed such as the thermohaline cooling belt and loss of productivity of the oceans. We are currently experiencing the loss of chlorophyll due to loss of inorganic nutrients because of thermal stratification of the water column leading to low levels of mixing and nutrient regeneration from deep ocean. The ocean is responsible for half of the world&#39;s primary productivity, and is declining at a rate of 1%/year which will have increasingly greater impacts on all life.</p>

CO2 emission throught lifestyle changes yet individual changes are not what we need in the face of the overwhelming pollution generated by the industrialization of China. It&#39;s even quite ridiculous to see ecologist media outlets praise small initiatives that concern only a few thousand people for each country.</p></li>
<li><p>Even the people who sympathise about this and are aware of the problems mostly won&#39;t take any daily life measures, not like these would be enough anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>Now to the most important point : governments not ready to take appropriate measures. Here in France the government tried to implement a carbon tax but the backlash was so violent that they had to cancel it. And then you see the sad spectacle at the latest 
international conference were the United States still take stand as vague as &quot;we need to do something&quot; when they should be doing something right now. The US is supposed to be the most important country and can&#39;t take leadership in this issue even using internal policy ? Furthermore it looks to me like other measures adopted during this meeting were remedies against the consequences of global warming, not against
its roots (funds for poor countries as a reparation for environmental desasters), as if everybody already internalized that we can&#39;t fight it. </p></li>
<li><p>One way to see it is that institutions in modern democracies just aren&#39;t designed to act on the long term and politicians won&#39;t take chances with actions that could damage their popularity. I read interesting proposals to have a new Republic (again French example) with a new Parliament room designed to plan further in the future (as opposed to our current parliaments : Assemblée Nationale which is elected directly by the people and the Senate which is designed as a representation of the more rural territories to put it simply). </p></li>
<li><p>Companies communicate a lot on their environment friendly actions but even those that are not simply greenwashing are not enough since the actions taken tend to reduce ecological print by some margin but don&#39;t alter the nature of our economical system, which is to keep producing and consuming. Economical growth is still king and governments just can&#39;t think without this tool, meaning that Degrowth proponents are always met with contempt or fear. People in the west simply aren&#39;t ready to renounce to their lifestyle  and in practice the only social movements that are largely repercuted by the media and that matter to politicians are those that demand to defend our consuming power.</p></li>
<li><p>With only small adaptations and not a big structural shift, we&#39;ll probably burn every single drop of oil in the ground, while being contempt with having a symbolic part of energy being renewable.</p>

t3_7qozh2	CMV: I believe removing public trash pickup would be an effective way to partially combat climate change.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>A main source of pollution in the modern world is overproduction.  Our culture produces more than it consumes and we end up throwing away a huge amount of waste.  </p>

<p>I think that the main driver of this is how detached we are from the waste we throw away.  Put it on the street and like magic it disappears from our lives.  Because of this people tend to have no problem buying things packaged in plastic and other non-biodegradable containers and throwing out whatever is left after use.  </p>

<p>I think it is reasonable to believe that if we got rid of public trash pickup, and instead were expected to bring it to a dump or recycling center ourselves, then it would force us to consider how much waste we actually create.  This would cause people to consume less in order to avoid the chore of bringing their trash to a dump.</p>

<p>I know that in more rural areas people may resort to burning trash or letting it pile up rather than driving to a dump site, but in suburban and urban areas a fine or some enforcement could be imposed to prevent that.  Perhaps that, in combination with some sort of tax credit for composting would end up having a not-negligible effect on combating climate change.</p>

For these reasons, I believe that if climate change is the biggest issue for you,  then it is best to vote for either a Democrat or Republican that you feel has the best climate policies because the next president is almost guaranteed to be from one of those parties. In this way,  voting green party actually removes a vote from a party that actually has the potential to win. </p>

These people work with the complexity that is American politics every single day, and you&#39;re telling me that they can&#39;t draw the same conclusion that everyone else can? It makes loads more sense that they are simply catering to special interests like oil companies, and trying to keep the voters on their side. </p>

t3_6jy4v3	CMV: Government policies to counter climate change will cause more harm than good.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I have always been a climate change skeptic for a variety of reasons but I acknowledge that I have deep seated prejudices that drive a confirmation bias towards this view. Further, I am finding it increasingly uncomfortable to find that most of the people I know who are climate change skeptics have other views that I really don&#39;t want to be associated with.</p>

<p>Thus, I would REALLY like to change my view on climate change and am very open to logical persuasion.</p>

<p>Here are the reasons behind my skepticism about climate change (and the value of government policies to stop/reverse it):</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I have strong libertarian views which make me naturally skeptical of any kind of government policies or actions. Thus, I will always give a higher weight to news that is suspicious of climate change rather than news that supports it since I am very saddened by the idea of seeing government programs come into place to address climate change (which ultimately impinge on individual freedoms to buy what they want, use land how they want, etc). Also, the fact that so much of the research into climate change is funded by governments (in one way or another) casts a pall of suspicion over the results in my mind. It only makes sense that scientists who rely on taxpayer dollars would want to draw conclusions that would result in yet more funding.</p></li>
<li><p>Wouldn&#39;t adapting to climate change be cheaper than stopping it? Climate change might just be a wash with some regions getting greener and others browner. Maybe growing wheat in the arctic isn&#39;t such a bad thing.</p></li>
<li><p>The climate has changed dramatically many times over millions of years. How do we know the climate wouldn&#39;t change even if humans didn&#39;t exist? The Anasazi civilization died due to a long term drought. The mini ice age of the middle ages killed the Viking colony in Greenland and caused the Thames to freeze over.</p></li>
<li><p>Many of the climate change advocates do things that really trigger me and cause me to discount what they say. For example, in a recent episode of &quot;Bill Nye Saves the World&quot; he cited lots of anecdotes about the changing climate but didn&#39;t get into any details about the science that help help explain why we know hot summers or storms aren&#39;t just part of the normal variation of climate. He concluded by throwing down reams of printed paper saying there was a government report that proved it. How can I evaluate that report? The whole show sounded very condescending to anyone who had questions and basically boiled down to &quot;trust me&quot;. This kind of argument doesn&#39;t engender a lot of confidence.</p></li>
<li><p>Can&#39;t natural occurrences influence the climate even more than human actions? The eruption of mount Krakatoa in 1883 caused massive climate disruption. Could a series of massive volcanic eruptions have a greater impact on the climate than the sum total of human activity from 1800 to 2017?</p></li>
</ul>

</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_e9cpgn	CMV: Climate Change requires instant ban of any new fossil fuel projects being started	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I see sound reasoning behind this view: </p>

<p>Climate change could effect many lives extremely negatively, probably ending quite a few, and no matter how much you disagree with the above statement, you have to agree that we must do something. </p>

<p>Also, fossil fuels are requiring less and less need - more wind farms and renewable energy sources are opening, and electric cars are also making an appearance. Hopefully we will not need fossil fuels soon.</p>

<p>But yet politicians aren&#39;t doing much to help climate change; Britain actually recently removed a bonus for driving electric vehicles, and especially with Brexit, climate change seems to be being ignored. I think drastic action is required to try to put a halt to something major that may or may not ruin the entire world.</p>

<p>But I see flaws in this point:</p>

<p>This would sink a few businesses (BP, however evil they may be will instantly flop, as with shell, etc.), And economy could fall - while at least I believe it&#39;s the world over money, I&#39;m open to new arguments, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m here.....</p>

<p>Edit: I&#39;m sorry if this was unclear, but I meant any new fossil fuel using plants or wells mines etc. couldn&#39;t be built, not all fossil fuels being banned.</p>

t3_27xbbv	CMV: I believe the only effective way of stopping global warming is through geoengineering.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>My first point is that even if we stopped producing all greenhouse gas emissions at this moment in time temperatures still wouldn&#39;t drop for hundreds of years. There is 0% chance of this actually happening but even if it did billions of lives would still be lost as the sea level continued to rise. Point 2 is that a large portion of America is still in denial about whether global warming actually exists. Now many of us would call them ignorant (which I&#39;m not saying they aren&#39;t), but we should expect this reaction from a good portion since it seems like there&#39;s nothing we can do to effect global warming (which to some extent is true) and an acceptance would mean they would have to change their lifestyles, and deal with the economic costs of making everything green (though even many who believe global warming is real don&#39;t do anything about it). Major industries too feel threatened by talk of society becoming green, so they bribe public officials into doing nothing about it. Now if developing geoengineering tech did become more of a priority, and it became a military project to save America or something, all of the people and corporations would stop hindering progress in reversing global warming since it would no longer pose a threat to their money or way of life. My third and final point is that even though at first using geoengineering will most like result in the loss of a few ecosystems, many more ecosystems would&#39;ve been lost if global warming had continued, and we would soon enough find the right patterns and use it to help all the other ecosystems flourish even greater then they are now.</p>

<p>Just as with nuclear energy their is great risk in giving humanity such great responsiblity, though the benefits once again outweigh the risks. CMV please.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t get me wrong, I know the long-term effects of water shortages, coastal loss, mass population shifts, affected agriculture, severe storms, and all the other horsemen of the climate apocalypse are the worst of it, but for some reason I&#39;m fixated on this &quot;drying up&quot; business.</p>

t3_5fwhjy	CMV: Switching to renewable energy sources will not solve the overall problem of sustainable human life on Earth. Changing consumption habits is necessary for sustainability.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So often I see disparagement of fossil fuels as the main drivers of climate change and the argument that if we can just switch to the right renewable energy sources we&#39;ll be fine. While I fully recognize that burning fossil fuels and using petroleum-based products contributes hugely to climate change and pollution, I do not believe that the current &quot;average Western lifestyle&quot; can be maintained even with a switch to renewables such as solar, wind, nuclear, etc. </p>

<p>I believe that the only way to maintain a quality of life on Earth for most people is to reduce levels of consumption of resources, including all energy and other non-fossil fuel resources. Westerners produce massive amounts of <a href=""https://center.sustainability.duke.edu/resources/green-facts-consumers/how-much-do-we-waste-daily"">waste</a>, and as less developed countries catch up they also are moving towards a consumption-based, <a href=""http://www.latimes.com/world/global-development/la-fg-global-trash-20160422-20160421-snap-htmlstory.html"">disposable culture</a>. Recycling and resource reclamation is a good last resort, but reducing overall consumption would be better. This isn&#39;t just about trash, either. The production of materials such as wood, paper, stone, glass, minerals, metals, food, etc. has a massive resource footprint in terms of land, water, labor, and energy and externalities such as pollution and habitat destruction.</p>

<p>A change from this lifestyle means reducing the number of things one owns and buys, how often they are replaced, a greater emphasis on multiple-use products (i.e. reusable grocery bag versus a plastic one used once), a greater emphasis on repairing items rather than replacing, a change in diet, change in transportation habits, more local production chains, etc. This also extends to the producers of goods, not just individuals, since massive amounts of resources are unnecessarily wasted in the production of goods as well. To be clear, I&#39;m not a luddite and I&#39;m not advocating going back to cave man days, but I firmly believe that we can all downscale by a lot and have just as good of a quality of life. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t believe that most people are willing to make this change in lifestyle. We want to just switch to solar and keep living the way we are living and I just don&#39;t think that is viable. Change my view.</p>

<p>I believe that there are large amounts of evidence that point to human interaction being a major influence in the Earth&#39;s dramatic climate change over the past few centuries.</p>

<p>Specifically, I would like to reference the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&#39;s <a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar4/wg1/ar4-wg1-spm.pdf"">report</a> on the topic. There are many important graphs and charts that I feel clearly support the idea that industrialization has been a major catalyst for the noted increase in greenhouse gas production, and the temperature changes associated with this.</p>

<p>Further support for my argument also results from the NASA Climate Change Portal, which prevents significant <a href=""http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence/"">evidence</a> that seems to support the fact that humans have had a significant impact on the relatively recent anomalies in temperature.</p>

<p>However, I am open to the idea that climate <em>is</em> random, and there are unknown factors and variables for which I may not have accounted. That being said, CMV on climate change.</p>

<p>I believe that humans will adapt to our new environment. We already are in some ways. We currently have urban farms that can produce 10,000 heads of lettuce a day. These farms use significantly less water and energy than traditional outdoor farms. Because of the developing industry, I doubt our lives would be greatly impacted by loss of farmland caused by drought. Scientists are working endlessly to create affordable desalination plants. Israel, a small desert nation, has recently ended its water crisis by building desalination plants and by recycling 80% of its waste water. The nation is proof that people create technology to adapt. How about cities being consumed by water. It is a tragedy to have an Exodus from a historical city, but it will happen slowly. Really, really slowly. Besides, we can build aquatic cities. A Japanese firm is already raising money to begin development on an underwater community.</p>

<p>I&#39;m not looking forward to the turbulent weather, but we do have buildings that are capable of surviving intense storms. My brother lives in Canada. Canadians have adapted to live in cold weather. They built underground tunnels in populated areas and have a well organized system for handling snowfall. </p>

<p>The argument regarding wildlife preservation is null. Though there may be a moral obligation to preserve wildlife, there is no logical reason to do so. All arguments should be presented logically. Arguments of morality will be dismissed.</p>

<p>To sum up my arguments, I am completely aware that global warming will result in tragedy, but the consequences can be mitigated through adaptation and technology. I don&#39;t see a reason why we should stunt global development in an attempt to prevent the inevitable. </p>

<p>Finally, I am not for air pollution. Anything that will cause health defects (excluding skin cancer) should be prevented from interacting with our lungs. </p>

t3_erg61z	CMV: Climate change is not something to worry about	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Lets start by saying I am NOT a climate change denier. I work in renewable energy (specifically air source heat pumps and solar thermal flat-plates) so green energy solutions are my day to day. As someone in the industry it might be news to you that Greta Thunberg and Extinction Rebellion are a bit of a joke. Yes they have a good message (in moral terms) but a gross misunderstanding of both the threat and task at hand.</p>

<p>Firstly there is already an extremely dangerous level of CO2 in the atmosphere, bringing carbon emissions to net zero would be great but even if we ignore the fact that with air travel and agriculture it&#39;s impossible; it also wouldn&#39;t solve the issue. We need to actually remove carbon at a sustainable rate in order to see any sort of change to the global climate. Here is the good news, the technology is there and has been for years. I won&#39;t bore you with the technical side but through DRC (direct air capture) it&#39;s possible to move air over substances that bind to carbon dioxide, they can then heat the compound to release CO2 in a compressed state to be stored underground. The catch is that this method is currently stupidly expensive, private sector expensive, which is why shouting at governments is not that helpful. The UK already offers a very generous RHI (renewable heat incentive) scheme and all political parties included shamefully unrealistic aims for air source heat pumps in their 2019 manifestos. All of the leading experts on the genuinely useful technology are involved with privately owned research companies, the leading of which are in America, Canada and Switzerland.</p>

<p>These private companies have the technology and funding to reverse climate change, but they are waiting for the crisis and fear mongering from the ill informed (sorry Greta) to reach it&#39;s peak before they do. Think about it, every year that we wait they can improve the technology and make the prototype DRC plants cheaper and more efficient, while the pressure on governments increases. Eventually the big players in world politics will be forced to throw money at the companies to enact their solution, by which point it will be optimised to profit everyone involved. So don&#39;t worry about climate change too much, because abstaining from lamb chops isn&#39;t going to save the world.</p>

<p>Edit: Seems to be a few misunderstandings and I don’t have time to respond to everyone but I am reading the comments. I’m not suggesting we “ignore” climate change but I’m putting to bed the idea that we’re inevitably doomed without immediate action, the solution is there it’s just not financially viable in its current state.</p>

t3_7eus2t	CMV: Urban western citizens cannot do anything about climate change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>First of all I want to preface the post by saying that I personally find climate change to be the greatest threat to humanity. </p>

<p>Living in a highly developed country, I try to do what I can to minimise my carbon footprint. I follow a flexitarian diet so 2/3 of my meals are 100% vegan, I don&#39;t own a car. I don&#39;t even commute by the bus, in the summer I bike to work and during winter I take the tram. I recycle pretty much everything I can even down to composting organic waste, I only try to buy organic, locally sourced ingredients and I have picked a utility company that sources 100% of their energy from hydroelectric dams.</p>

<p>But despite all of this, and despite the fact that many of my friends share a similar lifestyle, I realize that it won&#39;t make any actual difference to the total CO2 emissions. The fact is that our emissions are a drop in the bucket less than 0,001% of the world total. So even if my entire country would become entirely CO2 neutral it would make absolutely no difference.</p>

<p>The truth of the matter is that China and the US alone represent almost HALF of global CO2 emissions, they add up to a whooping 43,85% (2015), with the US contributing 16,1 metric tonnes of CO2 per capita! However breaking down those figures into states also shows great individual differences, for instance CO2 emissions per capita for a highly urbanized state like New York is 8,61 metric tonnes while Wyoming has 111,55 metric tonnes per capita. </p>

<p>I haven&#39;t studied it deeply but I think that that CO2 emissions probably follow the Pareto principle with 20% of emitters responsible for 80% of total GHG emissions and it is futile for those of us living in highly developed, urban areas to do anything about it because we do not have a high carbon footprint.</p>

"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>So I have been reading up on climate change and how it relates to the future, and needless to say I am scared shitless. For those not in the know, climate change is going to make the world a much much much worse place due to, but not limited too: multi meter sea level rise, droughts, famines, floods, superstorms, mass displacement in the millions or possibly billions. Again, I cannot stress enough how terrible climate change is. Humanity can technically avoid a catastrophe of this scale, but I think we won&#39;t. At this point, I have pretty much given up hope on a prosperous future for my theoretical children and grandchildren. Current projections estimate that we have between 30 and 50 years of relatively &quot;stable&quot; climate, but after that, things start to get bad; or more bad. I don&#39;t think we will do enough to stop the problem due largely to greed, corruption, hubris, and plain naivety. I don&#39;t think there is a very happy future for humanity in the coming decades and centuries. I for one, am just praying that I die before things start getting too bad. So CMV, can any of you really tell me I&#39;m wrong? I doubt it, but I&#39;m hoping for anything to make be feel less hopeless.</p>

<p>However, I only do so because it&#39;s humanity itself that is in danger. I don&#39;t believe we should protect our environment for it&#39;s own sake and it DEEPLY confuses me whenever I see (which is alarmingly often) comments on enviro-doom stories that show either resignation (i.e. &quot;Mankind will be a footnote on this planet&quot;) or misanthropy (i.e. &quot;Maybe the next species will do a better job&quot;)</p>

<p>HUmans are without a doubt the SINGLE most important thing on the planet. We are the only known species capable of sentience, compassion and the concept of ethics. Despite me despising these misanthropes, the fact that they EXIST and are so digusted by our actions to the point to wish for our demise is PROOF of our superiority: no other species is this self aware.</p>

<p>Until alien species on or superior to our level are found, we are definitely the supreme beings of this world. For lack of a better term, WE ARE GODS. Flawed gods, but gods nonetheless (akin to the often cruel, stupid and petty gods of Greek Mythology). If we were to die, we would leave behind a much poorer world. Yes, you might claim that the natural world is beautiful but what is beauty without a means to COMPREHEND it? If we were given the option to burn the world, burn the moon, burn the solar system, in exchange for prosperity for all, then I&#39;d say take it! Who ewould suffer in return? Animals who are barely aware of themselves, who, unlike some misanthropes claim, murder and rape for fun?</p>

<p>I realize this is an unpopularopinion and that&#39;s why I am here. Until you can convince me otherwise, Mankind reigns supreme.</p>

The future generations will have a technology we cannot even dream of, they will be able to genetic engineer new species and new things at an unprecedented rate. We are the ones who will suffer, death is upon us. Do I hate the past generations for the deforestation they did? Not a lot, because I am not an ungrateful bastard, I recognize that they had no knowledge and no technology, I accept the sadness of deforestation and all the sad fate of the species that went extinct since the humans first appeared on Earth, but I don&#39;t hate the people of the past, because that would make me an ungrateful bastard, I am a privileged human, THIS IS THE HIGHEST PRIVILEGE THERE IS (you talking about privilege? there is no higher privilege than being born later, white privilege, wealth privilege, all is small talk compared to the privilege of being born later!), having more technology and knowledge just because I was born later. And the people of the past didn&#39;t even know atoms and bacteria existed... and you will hate them and curse them? See? This is why I hate self-hating people, people who hate humanity for selfish reasons, that is the vibe many of the self-proclaimed climate change adepts give to me, they are so blind to the toughness of life itself and the struggles of the people of the past, just hating them on... blind to their death and will hate the people of the past and even themselves, ignoring the PRIVILEGES the future generations will have, all a hyperbole to draw attention, this is what climate change feels to me... Don&#39;t forget the people of the future will have genetic engineering and will be able to create any plant or animal that they so desire... Never forget the people of the future will be able to see things so small, they will see an entire universe we never saw, they are so privileged, and just because they were born later.... in the meanwhile we will all be long dead and forgotten, while they happily laugh with the technology and knowledge we never had, but with only our contributions and the contributions of all the past generations it was made possible for them, the privileged ones...</h2>

<p>TL:DR: There is no worse argument about climate change than the one: &quot;The future generations will hate us!&quot; Ah, yeah, those privileged people will hate us, ungrateful bastards if they do so!

t3_bg5fnj	CMV: Patanogia donating $10 Million towards climate change sets a bad precedent.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Title says it all really, <a href=""https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/business/patagonia-10-million-tax-climate-change-trnd/index.html"">here</a> is an article talking about what they did if you have not heard about it. </p>

<p>This is not a CMV about climate change, i&#39;m fully aware what is happening to our planet. </p>

<p>I have to be fully transparent here, originally I was going to say that Patagonia donating money toward climate change is unethical on the basis that it&#39;s unfair to the employees, you can&#39;t ask your employees to stay late, work harder, and not give raises and then just give away money, even if it was because of a tax cut. After doing some research and trying to refute my own original argument I found that Patanogia is an absolutely amazing place to work and they truly care about their employees. They are also a privately owned company so the CEO is free to do what they want with their profits. </p>

<p>I think what they should have done, instead of donating money, is given their employees the day off for Earth Day (which happens to be today; as a side note if you read this please do one good thing for the environment today!), and had a company sponsored optional event that involves picking up trash, planting trees, or anything that is good for the Earth. It would be just as good of PR as donating but there is actually something happening, and also it will improve employee morale because even if you don&#39;t share the same enthusiasm for improving the environment at least you get a paid day off. </p>

<p>The reason why I think this sets a bad precedent is because it is going to put pressure on other companies to start donating money toward climate change and just writing a checks as opposed to action. I think this is a poor solution because many companies are just looking for the media points, and the tax write offs, as opposed to actually doing something. </p>

<p>For example, XYZ Inc. contributes to a lot of pollution but hey the just wrote a 9 figure tax deductible check and all anybody reads is headlines so XYZ Inc. is a great woke company. </p>

<p>Another reason why I think it sets a bad precedent is because if Patanogia were to be a publicly traded company, I would be strongly against them donating this money. Most investors are not billionaires or even millionaires and are just people trying to put money away for retirement, to be invested fully in a company and have that company just give your money away to me seems unethical. With Patanogia doing this, I can&#39;t help to think now other companies are going to be pressured to start giving money to climate change, as opposed to action, or giving money to the shareholders that help keep the company afloat. </p>

<p>While there is no denying what Patanogia did is overall a good thing I can&#39;t help to think that other companies that don&#39;t take care of their employees the way they do are now going to be pressured to donate, which may not to be fair to the employees who work their or the shareholders who trusted that company with their savings.</p>

t3_exsrzt	CMV: POTUS's statement on Climate Change is Entirely fart.	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Sorry for the title, if this offends anyone, please let me know, but I will not change my opinion that this CMV deserves this title. In this CMV I will not be talking about Climate Change, i will be only discussing about how our dear POTUS &#39;s contradictory comments to himself.</p>

<p>As for anyone who is unfamiliar with our &quot;dear&quot; POTUS&#39;s statement on Climate Change, here is the quote from insideclimate news:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When U.S. government scientists released their latest volume of the <a href=""https://science2017.globalchange.gov/""><strong>National Climate Assessment</strong></a>, it revealed much about the robust, sobering scientific consensus on climate change. It also revealed the striking disconnect between President Donald Trump and essentially every authoritative institution on the threat of global warming. The president rejected the assessment&#39;s central findings—based on thousands of climate studies and involving 13 federal agencies—that emissions of carbon dioxide are caused by human activities, are already causing lasting economic damage, and have to be brought rapidly to zero.  </p>

<p>&quot;I don&#39;t believe it. No, no, I don&#39;t believe it,&quot; Trump said. Immediately, his cabinet members <a href=""https://insideclimatenews.org/news/30112018/fact-check-trump-climate-science-denial-national-assessment-sanders-global-warming""><strong>launched attacks on the report</strong></a>, portraying it as &quot;alarmist&quot; and clinging to Trump&#39;s agenda of fossil fuel energy expansion that the science says is at the root of the problem.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And here is some dear quotes from BBC.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the event (WEF, world economic forum), which had sustainability as its main theme, and activist Greta Thunberg as its star guest, Mr Trump dismissed &quot;alarmists&quot; who wanted to &quot;control every aspect of our lives&quot; - while also expressing the US&#39;s support for an initiative to plant one trillion trees.  </p>

<p>If you judge the president based on his words alone, his views on climate change appear contradictory - and confusing.  </p>

<p>He has called climate change &quot;mythical&quot;, &quot;nonexistent&quot;, or &quot;an expensive hoax&quot; - but also subsequently described it as a &quot;serious subject&quot; that is &quot;very important to me&quot;.  </p>

<p>Still - if you sift through his multitude of tweets and statements, a number of themes emerge.  </p>

<p>In 2009, Mr Trump actually signed <a href=""https://grist.org/politics/donald-trump-climate-action-new-york-times/""><strong>a full-page advert in the New York Times</strong></a>, along with dozens of other business leaders, expressing support for legislation combating climate change.  </p>

<p>&quot;If we fail to act now, it is scientifically irrefutable that there will be catastrophic and irreversible consequences for humanity and our planet,&quot; the statement said.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then, There is more!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>But even when he acknowledges the significance of climate change, he tends to frame it in terms of clean air and water (which are not directly related to climate change), or the cost to business:  </p>

<p>- <em>&quot;I think there is some connectivity [between human activity and climate change]. There is some, something. It depends on how much. It also depends on how much it&#39;s going to cost our companies.&quot; - NYT interview, November 2016.</em>  </p>

<p>- <em>&quot;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a hoax. I do think there&#39;s probably a difference. But I don&#39;t know that it&#39;s man-made... I don&#39;t wanna give trillions and trillions of dollars.&quot; - CBS interview, October 2018</em>  </p>

<p>- <em>&quot;Climate change is very important to me. I&#39;ve done many environmental impact statements in my life, and I believe very strongly in very, very crystal clear clean water and clean air.&quot; - December 2019</em>  </p>

<p>- <em>&quot;Nothing&#39;s a hoax about that. It&#39;s a very serious subject... I want the cleanest air, I want the cleanest water. The environment is very important to me. I also want jobs. I don&#39;t want to close up our industry because somebody said you have to go with wind.&quot; - January 2020</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Here is some statement from Climate Change Experts:</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, Joseph Goffman, executive director of Harvard&#39;s Environmental Law Programme, argues that Mr Trump &quot;believes nothing on climate change - he&#39;s a climate nihilist&quot;.  </p>

<p>Mr Trump&#39;s position is based on his need to appeal to &quot;the part of the Republican establishment that rejects climate policy,&quot; Mr Goffman, who previously worked as Democratic staff director on the Senate environmental committee, adds.  </p>

<p>Joseph Pinion, a <a href=""https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/422930-climate-change-denial-is-killing-the-gops-future""><strong>Republican strategist who has called for more action on climate change</strong></a>, also argues that Mr Trump looks at the issue from a political, rather than a moral perspective.  </p>

And the reason Democrats are OK with it not being a priority for them, is because they want to beat him.&quot;  </p>

<p>&quot;Ultimately it doesn&#39;t matter what President Trump believes, what matters is what he&#39;s doing - we need to recognise climate change is not a priority of his administration.&quot;  </p>

t3_4z90zf	"CMV: Humans will undergo a mass extinction event shortly, likely due to self-inflicted causes like global warming."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I&#39;ve read about all the damage that we have done to the planet. The waters are warming up and causing coral reef to die out. It&#39;s only a matter of time before other sea life such as algae die of in massive numbers. This combined with the forests being torn down, our oxygen supplies aren&#39;t looking so good. Then we have to worry about the sea levels rising, bringing in flooding and possibly washing away a lot of our land and even worse our crops. From all that I read in the news and from scientific journals, we don&#39;t have very much time left.</p>

<p>Even with all these signs that we put the world through too much damage and it may be too late, people still don&#39;t believe it is real. This includes people in power, who have been blinded by money from oil companies to realize that they can&#39;t eat drink or breathe cash. So we have a constant struggle just to try to enact environmental policies to try to save the planet, because some people want to make more money when they are already billionaires. </p>

<p>Most of the damage done seems to be irreversible. So even if we were able to get everyone to understand the reality of things and put all the money in the world into it, we still probably wouldn&#39;t do much good. We&#39;ll probably end up nuking ourselves anyway. So it seems best to start stockpiling food, water, and ammo. If you don&#39;t end up needing it, your kids or grand kids will be for certain. </p>

t3_5ckndl	CMV: I should give up trying to stop Climate Change	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>We made some small progress here in America during the last presidential term, but despite that, we&#39;ve already passed the point of no return with regards to Climate Change. No matter how hard we try, we can&#39;t fully reverse it. Now we (will shortly) have Donald Trump in the Oval Office, a man who has promised to repeal all Climate Changes acts, while the House and Senate are filled with a majority who likely agrees with him. The way I see it, the only way we can even stop Climate Change, not to mention reverse it, is to have someone in office as radical as Bernie Sanders with a House/Senate majority on his side. And that&#39;s just <em>my</em> country, don&#39;t get me started on China. I don&#39;t want to drown, please CMV.</p>

t3_cqmrbw	"CMV: We've reached, or very close to, the point of no return in terms of climate change and having a habitable world."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Lately news about climate change have become bleaker and bleaker. Insects are becoming extinct, which would eventually decimate the world&#39;s ecosystems. The loss of pollinators would drastically reduce food supplies. Even if we were to change for the better, anything short of a drastic cold turkey change, it would not be fast enough for us to leave a habitable world for our descendants. Every year there&#39;s some place with record temperatures</p>

<p>When it comes to insects and pollinators, climate change isn&#39;t the only culprit. Urbanization, pesticides, and herbicides are also a contributing factor. In the winter of 2018 in the US, 40% of honey bee colonies in the US died  <a href=""https://www.businessinsider.com/insects-dying-off-sign-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-2"">https://www.businessinsider.com/insects-dying-off-sign-of-6th-mass-extinction-2019-2</a> . According to Francisco Sanchez-Bayo, a researcher at the University of Sydney, In 10 years we would lose a quarter of the global insect by biomass, half in 50 years, and 100% in 100 years. One thing I&#39;m sure we all learn in middle school science classes is don&#39;t mess with the food web.</p>

<p>There has also been a trend in conservative politicians being elected. I&#39;m not saying all conservative policies are bad, but one thing many of them have in common is denial of climate change or refusal to create legislation or infrastructure to tackle this issue be it because of ignorance or corruption. For example, the current head of the EPA in USA is Andrew wheeler, a man who lobbied for coal producer Murray Energy. He&#39;s also the vice president of the Washington Coal Club (why is this a thing?). As you can see there is a huge conflict of interest here.</p>

<p>I genuinely hope to see something that changes my mind here since I&#39;ve just been becoming more and more cynical about the world. Please dig me out of this hole. What&#39;s depressing is that I feel like a good majority of the politicians in the world are bribed (sorry lobbied) by corporations that don&#39;t care about the environment and preserving a habitable earth in exchange for wealth.</p>

Doing nothing about climate change does not make you into a selfish person towards the future generations. When people try to guilty trip you talking of next generations they are being irrational. People who don&#39;t exist have no say in the matter, thus, any mention to future generations and tries to guilt people are nonsense. You can&#39;t be selfish towards something that DOES NOT EXIST.

<p>On a Federal Level, despite signing the Kyoto Protocol in 1997, and then ratifying it in 2002, we&#39;ve failed to meet our Kyoto targets and even posted an increase in Greenhouse gas emissions.  Furthermore, in 2006, we elected Stephen Harper, who was vocally against The Kyoto Protocol and in the latest election (2011) Environmentalism was a not a major issue, despite its leading to the election of a single MP for the Green party.  I believe, that if environmentalism was a national value, it would be better represented in federal policy and in the composition of the federal government.  In addition, in 2014, the proposal for the Northern gateway pipeline was accepted by the federal government, and seems to be preparing to succeed.  On a Provincial level, in British Columbia, the NDP party basically lost an election by clarifying its position on the northern gateway pipeline.  </p>

<p>In summary, if environmentalism was really a national value, it would be better represented in public policy.  </p>

Notice how all discussions about what can be done all boil down to &quot;Nothing. Enjoy your life&quot;. Maybe some people can take solace in that but not all. Even climate scientists <a href=""http://www.esquire.com/news-politics/a36228/ballad-of-the-sad-climatologists-0815/"">are showing signs of PTSD (and I think I might be as well)</a>.</p>

<p>Society should encourage the use of voluntary euthanasia. Aggresively campaign to tell people that anyone who chooses it is NOT a coward, is NOT selfish and they should NOT be mourned. In fact, they should be celebrated, because they have either transcended their base desire for survival (or never had it in the first place) and have made a decision that not only benefits them but the world at large as well.</p>

<p>It is sick how people are forced to keep playing the game of life even though they have already lost. People are brought into this world by the surpremely selfish desires of their parents who are either completely oblivious to the fact that their children will die drowning in their blood of the bodily fluids of their violators cursing their parents&#39; name while the latter will likely sleep soundly in their graves or because they want to make their own &quot;tribe&quot; to fight in the ashes convinced of their own superiority. The children never had a choice. If any of them did and could be conscious enough to understand it, no one would be borne.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t see the point in living in a post collapse world. I hate exercising. Most people I know are incapable of having a conversation that doesn&#39;t involve sports, travel or the weather and I can only assume the number will grow as access to the Internet collapses. The thought of having to grow my own food makes me sick, let alone the thought that 12 hours of my day will have to be spent there. Probably until my back gives out and I&#39;m left to die by the outside &quot;community&quot; that took me in before they realized I was &quot;weird&quot; and was looking for an excuse to murder me.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t want to learn self defense, I don&#39;t want to fight. I want to live in a world where specific people exist to protect me and as long as I don&#39;t do anything stupid, they won&#39;t hurt me. I want to live the rest of my life doing what I am told and being rewarded for it. I don&#39;t want to become a leader, I don&#39;t want to be responsible for people&#39;s well being. I never had any sort of relationship and perhaps it&#39;s for the best because if I did have a family during the collapse, I don&#39;t know what I would do.</p>

<p>More people like me must exist. We must help them.</p>

t3_det9iq	"CMV: ""Positive side of climate change facts, after two years of action, heading for 3°C with 1.5°C well within reach"" is wrong"	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>I am referring to <a href=""http://robertinventor.online/booklets/remarkable_progress.htm"">this piece</a> by Robert Walker.</p>

<p>I offer no scientific criticism or statistical analysis, and, indeed, my lack of expertise in those areas makes me concerned the statistics are being deliberately presented in such a way as to forsake the grim reality to instead engender hope. I am predisposed to think in terms of terrible outcomes being more likely than we give them credit for, and that good outcomes are too rare and precious to count on. Partly this is because I&#39;m depressed, partly because that is an important part of my job, and partly because I keep seeing a pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Climate change is moving as predicted&quot;</li>
<li>Observed reality indicates it is happening far worse than predicted</li>
<li>&quot;Trust the research, it&#39;s not as bad as you think&quot;</li>
<li>The research concludes it&#39;s far worse than previously predicted</li>
<li>&quot;Climate change is moving as predicted&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>To focus more specifically on the piece in question, one section strikes me as bad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>According to the IPCC report in 2018, we lose 99% of the corals after just a decade or so at 2 °C, and the reefs probably do not recover. If we don’t go much above 1.5 °C then 10 - 30% of them remain and they can recover, though this may take a long time. They can recover because they can adapt to warmer temperatures, as well as migrate and set up reefs in places that used to be too cold for them, but at 2 °C the warming is too rapid for this to work so well... no other major ecosystem on Earth is so sensitive, either in the sea or on land. The corals are the only entire ecosystem we risk losing at 2 °C.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Taking all of this as true, the sounds like someone failing to downplay catastrophe. Corals and coral reefs dying at the 1.5 degree rate would have an enormously negative impact on the ocean ecosystem and foodchain. And that&#39;s our <em>best case scenario</em>.</p>

<p>The whole thing comes across to me as optimistic denial using statistics. Not denying climate change exists, but the severity of it. I mean, to me, climate change is the single most terrible challenge humanity has ever faced because nothing else has threatened the very foundations upon which civilization stands. For all its devastation, the Black Death did not destroy the ecosystem; it was possible to rebuild.</p>

t3_ah0una	CMV: The issue of climate change is somewhat misdirection	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>[deleted]</p>
</div><!-- SC_ON -->"	
t3_2xospy	"CMV: International leaders aren't necessarily ""evil"" in that they refuse to do something serious about climate change or poverty; rather, they're all stuck in destructive competition."	"<!-- SC_OFF --><div class=""md""><p>Sometimes when reading about climate change and destruction of the environment, when reading about poverty and insufficient benefits of employment, when reading about the lack of regulations on corporations in terms of pollution, consumption, living wages, etc, and the incredibly high amount of tax breaks given to billion dollar corporations, it can be common for people to throw their hands in the air and decide &quot;our leaders are evil for causing, perpetuating, and/or refusing to solve these things!&quot; If one views the world in this way and one views these items as problems that need resolving, it can be easy to just think our leaders are evil for not fixing them and for causing or perpetuating them. </p>

<p><strong>However, I contend that while some leaders surly are &quot;evil&quot; simply because there must be <em>some</em> &quot;evil&quot; within any group of people, the current and recent world leaders who got us all into this mess and continue to participate in this mess are not necessarily &quot;evil&quot; for participating.</strong> </p>

<p>(I&#39;m choosing not to define &quot;evil&quot; here and keeping it in quotations to indicate that it&#39;s a hard to define word, because the actual word is irrelevant to my CMV. &quot;Evil,&quot; bad, negative, careless, selfish... just about any negative word will do.) </p>

<p><strong>We live in an international world with international competition and international investments. Countries are judged on their friendliness towards business investments</strong>, and to look good a country must have a strong economy, an ever growing GDP, and cannot have too many regulations and restrictions on corporations. <strong>Taking practically</strong> <strong><em>any</em></strong> <strong>step to curb climate change, curb poverty, curb pollution, etc, will involve a restriction or regulation on corporations doing business in that country and/or an added cost of doing business in that country. It will make the country less appealing to international business investments.</strong> And in a world of international competition, no country can afford to nor is willing to take a hit in this way. Nor can we realistically expect any country to. </p>

<p>So in this reality of our current world, <strong>our current leaders are locked in destructive competition and no country can take the first step to stop climate change or poverty or anything else like that because doing so hurts that country.</strong> (If no country ever does so, it hurts ALL of us... but that is the predicament that we&#39;re in.) So as frustrating as this current reality is and as easy as it is to assume the leaders who got us here and keep us here must be evil, my view is that they aren&#39;t necessarily evil - they&#39;re just stuck in destructive competition and can&#39;t move first. </p>

The most intelligent system we know of is human society. Unless there is reason to believe something can be smarter than human society our primary concern is improving and maintaining human society. The earth will probably be habitable for human society for at least a few billion more years without human intervention. The general trend of human society has been upwards since its formation. Unless improvement of human society is decreasing the goal should be to maintain human society as improvement is safely happening.</p>

<p>Humanity can undergo a total economic collapse and recover within at most a few hundred years. Even if we are set back to the bronze age we are still able to reach our current situation again. The only problems that we can&#39;t recover fully from would be permanent damage to the habitat of human society.</p>

<p>The major threats to the habitat of human society are climate change and nuclear holocaust. Every effort should be towards the prevention of climate change and nuclear holocaust. Every other issue is unimportant. With this moral view dealing with issues such as civil rights and corruption only matter if it helps prevent the end of humanity.</p>
