t3_90wbso	CMV: Veganism is the morally correct way of living	"Not being a vegan myself, I understand the convenience and benifits that meat provides. There are also times when eating meat is necassary such as when our food technology was not as advanced as today and meat held nutrients that couldn’t be found anywhere else
However with the knowledge about food we have today it has been proven that we don’t need meat in our diets to survive, therefore deeming meat an unnecassary evil.
Also whenever I see debates online between animal activists and meat eaters/farmers I always tend to side with the vegans argument
My thinking is if there’s a way to live without harming other conicious beings, why still choose to do it?
Someone convince me or I’ll either have to choose to be a vegan or a hypocrite  "	1	
t3_8zy756	"CMV: there are no real reasons for people in the developed world to still eat animal products, beyond taste and convenience"	"I’m not vegan or vegetarian myself, but I acknowledge that my decision to continue supporting the inarguably cruel and environmentally damaging animal industry is entirely selfish. Assuming that someone has the privilege to choose what type of food they eat - i.e. they’re an adult who isn’t disabled, has no food allergies to meat alternatives or health conditions that would make sticking to a vegan diet extremely difficult/impossible, lives somewhere with adequate vegan options for sale and is not impoverished/dealing with food insecurity - there’s no real reason beyond taste and convenience to continue eating animal products. 

We can get all necessary nutrients, besides vitamin B12 (which can be easily obtained via cheap and easily accessible supplements) from plant-based sources. Protein, iron, calcium, zinc etc. can all be obtained in pretty much any level from a well planned vegan diet, so veganism is pretty much possible no matter an individual’s specific dietary needs (aka low carb, high protein etc.) This is why I stand by the opinion that consuming animal products is entirely unnecessary for the majority of people in the developed world.

t3_eys2m3	CMV: Democrats should nominate Bloomberg to be their nominee	"1. He is an extremely competent and smart administrator who bases policies on data.
2. He supports key liberal platform issues, like right to abortion, climate change, and progressive taxation.
3. He appeals to moderates (in contrast with Sanders and Warren) because he clearly supports the basic structure and framework of free market American economy that most moderates do not want to mess with via revolutionary socialist changes. 
4. His prior record of bipartisanship will eat into Republican supporters of Trump."	1	
t3_buasit	"CMV:Labor had better policies, most people voted Liberal were tricked by marketing (Australian Federal Election)"	"Let me preface this by saying that I have no political agenda or allegiances, I am not salty about the election result or anything, what angers me most are the reasons people voted the way they did. If someone can give me liberal party policies and tell me why it benefits them, or Australia in general I can more than respect your view. However, in my experience so far most people voted the way they did because of these reasons:  


1. The ""Death/retiree"" Tax: Complete myth. This change to super would not affect 90% of people, it would only affect those with millions upon millions in superannuation. As we know, putting money into your super has certain tax benefits and this policy was mostly to stop those taking advantage, not to steal money from retirees or dead people. 
2. Negative Gearing:  This one is tough because your stance on this will generally be aligned with your personal affairs. But again, really only affecting those with enough negative gearing to have tax breaks. Point of the policy is to make house prices (which are currently ludicrous) in Australia more affordable for younger people. Biggest talking point here in my opinion is that Labor were looking to lower house prices while Liberals were looking to, at the very least, keep them where they are. 
3. Economy destroying climate policies: The liberals had no policies that had anything to do with climate change, while labor had a couple. I'm open to discuss them all however the biggest talking point was probably the energy/renewables policies.  I think one point a majority of Australian's can agree on is that SOMETHING should be done about the environment and climate change. There were stories circulating that the energy policy of labor would somehow destroy the economy and people would lose a large number of jobs. The longer you wait to combat climate change and the environment, the more expensive it will become. 99% of economists will tell you renewable energy is more efficient and cheaper than coal and in my opinion we should really be starting the switch from coal plants now rather than later. On that point however, I talk about the budget surplus below, but if the Liberals truly thought we would be in budget surplus, surely there was some room in the budget for a single climate change policy.
4. Increase in taxes: Another myth. Liberals cut taxes in their budget while Labor kept taxes constant. So all the marketing about the increase in taxes if Labor got in was actually just the difference between Liberals lowering them and Labor keeping them the same. On this point, the liberals in their budget actually moved towards a flatter tax bracket, whereby everyone got a tax cut, however those who benefited most were those earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. (Don't quote me, these are rough rough calculations from a couple of months ago but I think it was people earning around 150k will save 10k on taxes and those earning around 750k will be saving 50k on taxes a year). Regardless if the numbers are accurate, it was somehow construed that labor would be taking money from people and liberals would be giving it back.  
5. The Budget Surplus: The liberals claimed that we were going to be in Budget Surplus, and most people believe just being in a surplus is a good thing. Being in a budget surplus isn't actually the truth, we will not be in a surplus under the liberals - which is my first problem with this. It wasn't technically a lie to say we would be in surplus, however it is a large stretch of the truth and a number of unlikely things would have to happen in order for us to be in a surplus. My second problem is that everyone just assumes a budget surplus is good - it isn't good, nor is it bad. It depends on the economic conditions. I personally believe we aren't in an economic situation where we should be aiming for a surplus, even if we were in a budget surplus. 
6. Scott Morison is more professional than Bill Shorten: While the elected party leader becomes prime minister, their appearance has zero impact on how they run the country or otherwise implement policies. You aren't voting for Scott Morrison or Bill Shorten, you are voting for the policies their respective parties are going to implement. The head of the party has no more pull than your local member of parliament. 

&#x200B;

While I definitely understand that an election campaign is as much about marketing as anything else, a party should not be elected because they undermined the other party better. They should be elected on how well their policies affect you and Australia in general, and in my opinion many people got lost in this. Obvious small sample size but they people I've talked to about this and sometimes taken by surprise when I bring up some of these points.

Happy to go into further detail regarding the points I've brought up, or to go into new points someone brings up."	1	f
t3_2gxwbi	"CMV: I think Economics is largely a backwards field rooted in pseudoscience, unscrutinized cultural biases, and political manipulation."	"Before I begin - I want to clarify that I do not believe the fundamental intent of the field of Economics is invalid.  There is definitely a utility to exploring how goods and services are distributed across a society and many fields have benefited from certain basic concepts developed in Economics.

But on the whole, I generally think Economists are full of it.  Now I am by no means an expert in the field and this perception may just be the result of my own ignorance, I got my degree in Physics.  But it seems to me that the field is defined by political agendas (whether they be extolling the inherent benevolence of Free-Market Capitalism or pushing for greater involvement in the economy) rather than the objective and open-ended pursuit of knowledge as found in the sciences and to a lesser extent the social sciences.  Economists seem hopelessly rooted in the worship of figures like Smith, Ricardo, Keynes, and Marx, stubbornly committed to reworking their theories into something that sort of fits the economic realities they can't ignore and jives with the political principles they like.  While most Social Sciences seem to have an issue political agendas, Economics looks completely and fundamentally broken in its lack of rigor. Even in fields like History or Anthropology where there is considerable politicizing, there is a broad consensus on the fundamentals of methodology and the legitimacy of certain ideas that keeps everyone on the right track.  Meanwhile, you have Economists like Paul Krugman and Steve Keen not just forwarding their respective political platforms, but disagreeing about the **fundamental operation of economies.**  I haven't seen anything like this in any of the other social sciences.  I haven't seen Sociologists debate whether or not social stratification even exists, Linguists reject the idea that cultural pressures can change languages, or Archaeologists fight over whether or not settlement patterns can tell us about cultural evolution.  When I read about each of these fields, I see a clear progression in their work: a refinement of methods, a building of knowledge, the revision of basic assumptions to fit new data.

Then I read pieces by influential Economists that [basically confess the cluelessness of people working in the field](http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/06/magazine/06Economic-t.html?_r=0) on the one hand and on the other hand assert that their theories [don't require empirical validation](http://mises.org/epofe/c1p2sec2.asp) and I can't help but think ""Wow, the emperor has no clothes."" While Economists (hilariously) try to create an air of credibility to their work by expressing their theories with mathematical formulas, the doesn't change the fact that the basic ideas that underpin the field are based not on empirical data but rather the assumptions they've made about the world and humanity.  ( [A Mathematician put out a critique about Economists' use of mathematics a few years back that I really enjoyed.](http://ineteconomics.org/blog/inet/economics-not-math) )  It continues to be rooted in empirically invalidated and scientifically outdated ideas like humans being fundamentally individualistic and rational simply because that is the way Western society currently likes to understand itself.  The fact that this has gone largely unchallenged in the field and that many of the field's seminal concepts were derived from the [haphazard reworking of Newtonian equations](http://books.google.com/books?id=xA4Y3lkcpscC&pg=PA179&lpg=PA179&dq=david+ricardo+newtonian+equations&source=bl&ots=JrCF7Cot_s&sig=tCpgQ31mlctVtDToQ2A6GUsWYa0&hl=en&sa=X&ei=7lMdVKSTJ4WGyASx2YIQ&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=david%20ricardo%20newtonian%20equations&f=false) says that both in terms of its internal discourse and topical theorization, Economics is very shallow and just about keeping the illusion of knowing what you are talking about.  Psychologists have embraced Neuroscience, Historians have begun to employ Computer Science, Biology has come to play a fundamental role in Anthropology, and Geography is constantly reworking itself to incorporate the work done in the hard sciences.... but Economists seem intent on ignoring the work of other fields and pretending they have all the answers.


Economics has limited predictive power and every time Economists claim to be able to explain something, some new economic catastrophe occurs and they're all left scratching their heads, trying to figure out why their explanations don't conform to reality.  But the worst part? The worst part is the fact that of all the social sciences, Economics has the most sway in our society.  It isn't supported and respected as a field because it tells or explains economies very well but rather because it feeds into whatever businesspeople and politicians alike want to hear.

t3_22qmq8	CMV: I believe that fracking is a good option for energy production and should be pursued. I consider myself an environmentalist.	"While there are certainly some negative aspects to fracking, the contamination of ground water being the most concerning, I think that fracking is a good option for domestic energy production. My main support for this idea is that energy must come from somewhere and the natural gas that is produced through fracturing is much cleaner and produces energy much more efficiently than coal or oil. Fracking is also being done on US soil, which has positive implications for the economy and gives the public more over site. A lot of environmental degradation is outsourced to other countries so that the US can benefit from the energy that is produced. While I know that the US is a beautiful country and I do not want to so it destroyed, but the US also has some of the strongest environmental laws in the world. I like having resource extraction on US soil because it means that the extractors are subject to US laws. 

Now I know fracturing does cause some environmental problems, but I think this could be minimized by stricter regulations on the mixtures that are going into the ground. I consider ground water a very valuable resource and if fracturing is causing contamination then steps should be put in place to minimize those leaks. This may mean that fracturing cannot be done everywhere, but there are certainly places where it is a good option.

t3_kbucpc	"CMV: Even if Atheists were presented with proof of a God, they wouldn’t accept its existence."	"Let me preface this by saying that I myself am an atheist.  Furthermore, I am aware that generalizations are not 100% accurate, and I really mean that *the vast majority* of atheists wouldn’t accept the existence of a god if provided sound evidence.  In the case of that vast majority, if presented with valid evidence, they would either a) deny the existence of said evidence, b) accept the existence of whatever it was that was proved but not accept that the thing is god, or c) plug their ears and ignore the person giving the evidence entirely.  

Not sure if it entirely matters, but the only reason I’m bringing this up is because of a debate between Bill Nye and some nondescript religious person had a debate where Bill Nye claimed he would change his views on god if presented with evidence, which I believe is a load of hypocritical bull, and the only reason I’m posting this here is because unpopularopinion shadowbanned this post for no reason.

t3_bhacy9	CMV: Protests are useless in the modern era	"I can understand the importance of protests in the past, such as the famous ones with MLK, etc, but the fact of the matter is they don’t work anymore. Think about how many protests have happened just in the past few years? All those “March for Sciences,” not to mention that Women’s March which was (I believe) the largest protest ever conducted worldwide.

And what did they do? Literally nothing. No one’s mind was changed who matters, no laws were enacted, not even the public discourse really changed. Even going out and doing disruptive protests such as blocking traffic etc does anything because it’s not impacting the people who actually matter. Sure, maybe you convince a couple more schmucks that climate change is a big deal, but does that change anything in the long run? Absolutely not. Our corporate overlords keep chugging away, and we get closer and close to our inevitable doom.

In my opinion, if you want change, it needs to be more radical, but I’ll refrain from posting my own opinions on the matter so I don’t get banned. Change my view."	1	f
t3_os8pwd	"CMV: Nuclear power, while dangerous at times, is as useful as wind and solar energy"	"There’s been a push for decades now against nuclear power plants and the dangers that come with it. Using examples such as the Chernobyl and Fukushima nuclear disasters, but while these were tragic, this doesn’t represents nuclear safety and the benefits that nuclear power has as a whole. 

75% of Frances energy comes from nuclear power plants and a lot of Sweden’s power is the same, I don’t know much about European power plants, but I haven’t heard much of any accidents occurring in these areas, at least nowhere near the level of others. And while climate activist have sort of stopped nuclear power plants from being built in European countries it hasn’t stopped other countries from mass producing them, a example would be China that puts a new one on the grid every two to three months, supplying its citizens with plenty of energy, and it’s the same in other countries.

So why do we see nuclear power as so dangerous, this is most likely caused by the mentioned nuclear disasters I said earlier. Fukushima while definitely a disaster, acutely didn’t reach dangerous radiation levels. While there definitely was a spike in radiation, it was actually all under the regular safety limit for most nuclear power plants. It was sadly due to mass panic that led to many deaths that occurred not too long after, helping to bring up suicide and depression rates in that time period during the mass evaluation. 

Chernobyl is another example of a terrible tragedy, and while this is definitely A terrible event with mass radiation everywhere way above the lethal limit in some areas. This was all caused by cutting corners or poor maintenance. The reason the plant cut corners was too please soviet dictators of the time as this was a part of Soviet Russia and we all know their standards were really low. But since the Soviet Union disbanded, The Russian government has tried their best to lower the radiation limits, and in fact you can now stand right outside the big dome that was put over top of the plant, and you will not be susceptible to lethal amounts of radiation. No nuclear reactor today will be built like Chernobyl, it will have some of the highest safety regulations that any can get.

Even when you include all the deaths from major nuclear power disasters, It comes nowhere near the amount of deaths in other power fields such as Coal, Oil, and Natural Gas. It’s even almost as safe as wind and solar in this regard.

Another reason why people don’t like nuclear power is the waste that is generated from it. But even if you collected all the nuclear waste from just America’s power plants for 60 years straight, The waste that would be generated would only fill The size of an average Walmart, which is somewhat big, but it is pretty easy to get rid of. Bury it hundreds of miles into the earth, or even just shoot it off into space with a few rockets. 

The cost is another thing that’s actually good about nuclear energy, it’s just as cheap as wind and solar, making it good for costs, and it also helps to manufacture them a lot easier. Though right now with Americans regulations, we can only build a nuclear power plant every 12 to 15 years and it can take up 6 to 7 years just to get permission to start building. 

While nuclear power can definitely be dangerous in the wrong circumstances, it is a better alternative to other forms of energy, based on its safety, Energy efficiency, and Low costs"	1	
t3_p48g7e	CMV: The United States Senate is going to cause the United States to fall behind as a world power because it bricks progress and legislation from being passed	"I personally do not see a use for the Senate.  In theory, the senators are supposed to enact the interests of the state but in reality the senators pander to their political party.  Representation is based entirely on States and not population so we end up having a backwards system where less people have more political power in federal legislation.  They are supposed to be a check in the separation of powers but they really have the same bias and agenda as politicians in the house of representatives so they aren't serving as anything extra beyond them.

No other system where one group of people having extra voting power would be deemed fair.  For instance, people say it prevents tyranny of the majority but that logic is flawed.  By that same logic, we should let blacks, Muslims, gays, trans, atheists, etc. have more voting power but no one who favors the Senate will favor that.  Also the Senate doesn't prevent tyranny of the majority, that's just a talking point.  Many minorities have been heavily discriminated against in this country's history.

With all my issues said I truly think the biggest problem with the Senate is they kill much legislation and progress from happening in this country.  This is my biggest concern about it by far.  Not necessarily that they over represent rural America more in an unfavorable way. 

Since the filibuster was created by accident by Aaron Burr, it's allowed the group to kill most legislation that doesn't get a supermajority so many things don't get passed.  It has been heavily exploited in the civil rights era and in the current polarized political era.  Since the Senate already greatly overrepresents rural parts of the country and a 60% threshold is needed on top of that to bypass the filibuster, many pieces of legislation don't advance.  Because of the rural bias with the 60% threshold, in reality it becomes something like 80% of Americans represented in the Senate have to agree before anything can pass.

This means things like federal protections to voting rights, healthcare reform, environmental protections, marijuana legalization, etc. that are favored by a majority of Americans can't pass because a supermajority of elected officials (again heavily biased by rural America) won't agree to it.  So in essence, something like 80% of Americans have to support something before it starts becoming viable to pass the Senate.  The only group that gets to bypass this is special interest groups that can pay off senators.

Throw in the special interest lobbying and playing of politics where one side will always vote a against the other party's legislation no matter what and we have a very broken system.  For instance, it was just leaked ExxonMobil explicitly supports a carbon tax because they 100% know that it will never pass in the Senate so they get free PR by lying that they support it.

In the end, I fear the Senate will be the undoing of the United States being a leader, innovator, and staying ahead in the future.  I suspect most things will stall and we will fall behind.  My greatest fear is we will end up like the Rome with a failed empire and a major cause will be the gridlocking caused by the Senate."	1	f
t3_p9aita	CMV: Respecting people for eating meat is not on the same level as respecting people for not eating meat.	"As you can tell from my title, this post will be about the phrase I often hear in talks around my veganism: ""I respect you not eating meat, so you should respect my right to eat meat."" I find this to be a rather silly argument, and I'd like for people to change my view on this. The reason I want my view changed is I don't generally like to go around not respecting people as a general rule, so if the opportunity arises, I will surely take it.

The statement made in the title is somehow controversial. I guess in some people's minds, they see two diets, one containing meat, and one not containing meat, and they equate the two in their head, saying they are both personal choices.

And while I agree they are personal choices, I do not agree they are equal, and here's why: People choose to not eat meat for various reasons, the big three being health concerns, environmental concerns, and ethical concerns. You may or may not have heard it before. In addition, there are socio-economic concerns, such as the inefficiency of meat production and the impact it has on vulnerable indigenous populations, or populations in developing countries. There is also the concern of food scarcity, that being we're feeding so much crops to billions of billions of animals, that we do not get to keep feeding a growing number of people in the world. While the last one can be accounted for by corrupt governments refusing aid and education to their population, the population of earth will keep growing, and we do not have food for future generations for much longer.

All of these reasons add up to what I'd view as a pretty big deal. A deal that makes all of the difference when it comes to the two diets being equal. 

Just because two things share the same characteristics, being a diet, that does not mean that they are equal in terms of impact or respect they should incite. I do not believe that we should respect other people's choice to hurt animals and the environment as much as we should respect people's choice to avoid doing those things as much as possible.

I'm not here to argue that people are bad people for eating meat, but rather that one is clearly worthy of more respect than the other, and that they are not equal in terms of the respect they should command, and exchanging respect over these different diet choices is not an equivalent exchange of respect.

Change my view."	1	f
t3_amlex6	CMV: The value of a thing is defined by its scarcity and its utility. There are 7 billion people on this planet. We overvalue the lives of individual humans.	"First of all, let's stipulate to the idea that value is defined by scarcity and utility. A thing that is rare is valuable, because it is either irreplaceable or difficult to replace (i.e. gold is more valuable than gravel). Alternatively, it is value correlates to the importance of the utility it serves (i.e. prestigious awards are given to researchers who contribute meaningfully to their fields).  


The UN says that the [current global population](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/news/population/2015-report.html) is over 7.3 billion. So, human lives are not valuable due to scarcity.  


Moreover, the utility of the average human being is almost nothing. Most people live out their lives without serving to progress the human species intellectually, morally, or socially. We simply don't matter. Within 100 years of their deaths, no one will even remember the names of most of the 7 billion people alive today. They will be utterly forgotten to history. What's worse, the environmental impact of each individual (though marginal) endangers the stability of global climate and, therefore, threatens future life on earth.  


I think it would be tempting to default to a Golden Rule solution here - I certainly don't want anyone deciding *my* life is unimportant. On the other hand, I think there are far more people that the world could do without than the average person cares to admit. We don't execute career sexual predators in America, but would there be any harm if we did? Or what about people who are just really, really self-centered jerks? Would anything *really* be lost if the average jackass got obliterated by Thanos? I kinda don't think so.

t3_4bjny3	CMV: The distribution of human knowledge and the way human knowledge advance render democracy obsolete.	"I was having a conversation last night with a former friend who flatly denied climate change, spouting a whole load of anti-science rhetoric at me, and it occurred to me that she had just as much power as I to put Senators or the President into office. This is, frankly, a pretty ridiculous situation. The post title may be a wee bit incendiary--but the the view I am open to changing is that not everyone who is a citizen should be able to vote.

The fact that climate skepticism and the anti-vaccine movement have become so strong suggests to me that it is simply not a good idea to give everyone a vote. The best-qualified people to handle problems like infectious outbreaks and climate change are forced to put their ideas up to the public vote--I personally think a fair effort to educate people is being made.

Climate change and the efficacy/safety of vaccines are not up for debate, and extremely consequential. We used to be done with measles, and we're not anymore. People are literally dying because a decline in herd immunity. /rant

t3_6epun4	CMV: Rank and file Democrats should be more vocal about party elites gigantic carbon footprints.	"I like to think actor and environmentalist Leonardo DiCaprio woke up in his SoCal beach home, took a private jet to France, boarded his 450 foot yacht, tweeted his support of the Paris Agreement, flew some friends in for dinner, then will take another private jet back to SoCal tonight.  I don't know if any of that actually happened but, given his lifestyle, it's reasonable.

I have no idea where John Kerry tweeted his support of the Paris Agreements from.  It's just hard to keep track of the whereabouts of someone who owns five homes.  Former Pres. Obama just purchased the 8,000+ sq foot home he had been renting and is keeping his Chicago home too.  Cher was probably in her 16,000 sq foot Italian Renaissance inspired SoCal home when she tweeted about Trump being insane for not recognizing the dangers of global warming.  

This CMV isn't about the agreement.  This CMV is about the lifestyles many Democrat heavyweights live being hypocritical when compared with their views on the agreement and climate change in general.  There's no way around it: Many of them have huge carbon footprints from lives spent in mansions, yachts, private jets, etc.  It was 10 years ago that we learned super-environmentalist and Democrat presidential nominee Al Gore had a $30,000 utility bill and a carbon footprint the size of a small island nation.

While Democrats spend a lot of time and effort shaming Republicans over their views on global warming, rank and file members of the party are far more forgiving of their elite's jet setting ways.  The should be calling them out on it.

t3_1zdsm5	If we believe that animal lives have even very small value there is an unavoidable conclusion that our current practice of eating animals is an atrocity of unrivaled proportions throughout all of recorded history. CMV	"Suppose that we define a very small value for the life of a non-human animal being 1/1000 of the value of a human life.

According to the [Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations](http://faostat.fao.org/site/569/default.aspx#ancor) over 60 billion land animals were slaughtered in 2012. 

Using our estimate above this would be the ethical equivalent of 60 million humans being slaughtered. This is roughly equivalent to the number of humans slaughtered in every recorded genocide in human history combined, and it is happening every single year.

Simply by acknowledging that non-human animals can have any significant value to their lives, we reach the unavoidable conclusion that using and slaughtering animals in the ways they are currently being used (primarily for food) is an atrocity that is unrivaled in scale throughout all of recorded history.

t3_4iem2j	CMV: I don't think that making First Contact will cause dramatic upheaval in human society.	"
First Contact is the discovery of alien life, and by dramatic upheaval, I mean something quick that causes society to breakdown.

If we received radio transmissions from aliens tomorrow (or some other form of proof) that incontestably proved the existence of advanced alien life, I don""t think our lives would fundamentally change. The basics of living and being human would still be the same, and it would change nothing but high level government policy and a handful of doctrines for the time being.

I don't think many people would riot or kill themselves or start new wars. I don't think that we'd be unified as a species or tolerate each other that much more or receive some sort of spiritual awakening. Each doctrine and philosophy would slightly adjust itself to account for the new possibility, but most intelligent people have probably already accounted for the vague possibility of life outside earth. The immediacy makes little difference.

**Of course, in the long run, the human race would be changed significantly. But immediate term shifting of strategic priorities, political talking points, and art aren't what I mean by a dramatic upheaval. An upheaval to me is a mass panic or something like it.**

I believe that people pretty much tend to stick together when shit goes down. For example, in response to major terrorist attacks, [people have been found to stick around and help. Genuine panic is actually quite rare.](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/affiliates/panic/Crowd%20behaviour%20in%20CBRN%20incidents.ppt)

In this study on morale during WW2 and panic caused by modern terror incidents, [panic is usually a limited spike of quiet grief, and people really only tend to evacuate if forced to or if their houses are destroyed.](http://www.simonwessely.com/Downloads/Publications/Other_p/111.pdf)

Unfortunately, for many of these problems one group will simply reject the solutions provided without providing alternatives. ""No, that's a terrible solution but yeah its a problem I dunno what to do about it"". I understand there are definitely good and bad solutions, but by simply opposing decent solutions NO progress can be made. It would be useful to point out a problem that people hadn't realized is a problem, but since these problems are widely recognized, just pointing it out is useless. 

For example, if your buddies, you, and your friend Steve (sorry to anyone named steve) were planning a camping trip and needed a tent.

1. You said hey we should pool our money and buy one! And your buddies said sure, but Steve said ""it costs too much, no.""
2. You said we should ask our friends and neighbors for one! Your buddies said sure, but Steve said no then we'll look poor. 
3. You said alright lets try to make one! Again, Steve comes in with it would take too much work and take too long. 
4. Alright Steve, what would your idea be? ""I dunno, I don't like any of these solutions, but yeah I agree we need a tent.""

At this point Steve is not just being useless but also actively preventing the group from working towards the goal. It would be completely fair to just continue ahead with the groups plans regardless of what Steve thinks, even if it makes him upset. 

I see this same thing with politics. I'm an American leftist so I'm only listing things that I've come across, but if people from other groups could tell me about examples from other countries or other sides of the political spectrum I would be grateful. 

1. Climate Change: Liberals say lets invest in renewable energy research and production so we will have a viable alternative farther down the line and can currently make a gradual transition away from gas. Republicans debate whether climate change is real and say solutions are too expensive. 
2. Poor communities: Liberals say we should educate children in less privileged schools about not just college opportunities but also trade jobs that offer paid apprenticeships. Republicans say well, their parents shouldn't have had kids. 

I'm sure there will be people that argue that they are not harmful just neutral, but when these individuals prevent plans from being implemented they do end up actively doing harm in my opinion. That being said, I think this is definitely a newer opinion of mine since I used to have a no harm no foul mindset. I'm trying to see if this new opinion is deficit in significant ways."	1	f
t3_p1v65a	CMV: Climate Inactivists Are Likely Doing More Harm Than Good	"Climate Inactivist: Someone who advocates against individual action against climate change. 

You see climate inactivists all over reddit. Some of it comes from previous climate change deniers spreading misinformation about how futile our individual efforts (like giving up meat or adopting instead of birthing) are because they have realized that you can no longer convince people that climate change is a myth, so the way to calm people down is to tell them it's not worth trying anymore. 

Other climate inactivists come from people who likely have taking this approach because it's easier not to have a sense of personal responsibility for the damage you are causing. It's easier to think ""it's the corporations fault"" and waive your own actions that are actually funding these corporations to do the damage you are paying them to do. To me this is no different than paying a hitman to kill someone and then saying you're not responsible for the death. 

Other climate inactivists might have just been misled by others. It's whatever, the point is, it does more harm than good. For one, every little bit helps. Climate change is a cumulative issue, everything contributes. Just because it's futile trying to prevent it doesn't mean it's pointless to try and reduce it. Those who are going around telling people we aren't responsible, it's just the corps, we shouldn't need to make sacrifices because those in charge aren't making sacrifices too, etc are doing more harm than good."	1	
t3_23hbmx	"CMV: Being anti GMO is an extremely conservative position, and that many ""liberals"" are far from progessive"	"This CMV is not about whether or not GMO's are good. I should start off by saying that I am very pro GMO, but the subject of whether they are good or bad has been debated far to many times on this subreddit and the answer is always overwhelmingly clear.

My position is that being anti GMO is a conservative position. GMO's are a new technology that many people are afraid of. They are afraid of it because it changes the nature of the food that we eat. The people who are against GMO's want to keep farming the way it has always been done, no matter how inefficient. This shows extreme caution to change and a general refusal to accept new technology. This is near the definition of conservative.

Also many liberals argue against automatization. Automatization is the key to progress and has been shown over and over again to create more jobs in the long term than it initially takes in the short.

I believe that many kids like the idea of being called progressives and liberals because they want to make a change in the world. But they are doing the opposite by being anti-GMO and anti automatization.

I also think that it is incredibly hypocritical to be anti-GMO and not anti nuclear power as both are efficient new technologies that may (most likely not) cause harm. I believe that people aren't looking at their beliefs and just listen to whatever the person closest says first.

To change my view show me how my definitions are wrong or how attempting to inhibit technology is not a conservative viewpoint.

The IPCC (via the SR 1.5) has given us until 2030 to reduce emissions by 45% in order avoid irreversible catastrophic climate change.

When I ask them, a lot of people talk about Monsanto, but I believe they're bad because they use shady business practices (child labour, hijacking prices, forcing farmer to commit suicide, etc.), not because they grow GMOs. The actual science of the matter doesn't appear to have any conclusive data either, and the scientific community doesn't seem to be addressing GMOs any where near as intensely as they do things like climate change, disease, etc.

So why do people hate GMOs? Is there any legit data out there that's been swept under the rug? Or is this just a sheeple fad that's going around, and people just hate GMOs because that's what's ""in"" these days?

t3_920s2w	CMV: Religions never solved the problem of evil and Epicurus argument holds fast.	"
I've been reading a lot about the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil in my spare time. There are a few theodicies/defenses but not a single one is logical or consistent. Evil and suffering are interchangeable in this argument. We assume discussed god created the universe.

Let's get through them one by one :

Free will defense:

God permits evil because it is necessary for free will:

1. That does not explain natural disasters that cause human suffering which are in no way created by human action (disease/avalanches/the_donald etc.)
2. Omnipotent being could create a world where capacity for evil is not necessary for free will - in Christianity it's called heaven. Alternatively there is no free will in heaven (which contends what Christian theologists say).

The suffering we endure is justified by the heavenly reward:

1. It boils down to is it morally ok to kick a child in a face if you give him a really nice candy afterwards?

Evil is illusory/doesn't exist:

1. For the person suffering it is, and even most of the theologians with Augustine agree that this is a lousy attempt.

Prevention of greater evil (God permits lesser evils to prevent greater ones):

1. Omnipotent being can prevent all evils.
2. Every kid that has cancer is predestined to do something horrible in the future. 
3. Free will does not exist in this defense.

I think this is the weakest point of any religion that claims omnipotence and benevolence of god. The solutions that we are left with are:

1. There is no god. 
2. God is malevolent/doesn't care.
3. God is not omnipotent.

I'll be bold enough to state that this pretty much proves that god cannot love us as we understand the word 'love'. If it was in your power to prevent a kid you love from getting cancer you would do it. You'd stop rape/war/every single instance of suffering from affecting your loved ones. God does not. Change my mind.

t3_nkqd08	CMV: Governments should encourage and incentivise plant based diets	"Currently meat farming is incentivised by numerous subsidies available despite it's destructive properties:

""*According to recent studies, the U.S. government spends up to $38 billion each year to subsidize the meat and dairy industries, with less than one percent of that sum allocated to aiding the production of fruits and vegetables.""* (source: [https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/removing-meat-subsidy-our-cognitive-dissonance-around-animal-agriculture](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/removing-meat-subsidy-our-cognitive-dissonance-around-animal-agriculture)).

*""Just 1% of the $700bn (£560bn) a year given to farmers is used to benefit the environment, the analysis found. Much of the total instead promotes high-emission cattle production,* [*forest destruction*](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/mar/31/subsidies-to-industries-that-cause-deforestation-worth-100-times-more-than-aid-to-prevent-it) *and pollution from the overuse of fertiliser.""* (source: [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/sep/16/1m-a-minute-the-farming-subsidies-destroying-the-world)).

One of the reasons governments should consider prioritising plant based farming over meat farming is because of the way low quality meat creates health concerns. [See the World Health Organization's Q&A on the carcinogenicity of red meat and processed meats.](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/cancer-carcinogenicity-of-the-consumption-of-red-meat-and-processed-mea) And plant based farming can be regeneratively healing to the point of r[eversing the effects of conditions like diabetes](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5466941/).

It is also worth noting that the Director General of WHO has also called for a reduction in animal farming particularly about antibiotics resistance:

*""In some countries, approximately 80% of total consumption of medically important antibiotics is in the animal sector, largely for growth promotion in healthy animals....'A lack of effective antibiotics is as serious a security threat as a sudden and deadly disease outbreak,' says Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of WHO. 'Strong, sustained action across all sectors is vital if we are to turn back the tide of antimicrobial resistance and keep the world safe.'* (source: [https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance](https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2017-stop-using-antibiotics-in-healthy-animals-to-prevent-the-spread-of-antibiotic-resistance)).

Another relevant health concern is that animal agriculture [dramatically increases the likelihood of world-stopping pandemics](https://www.foodnavigator.com/Article/2021/02/02/Scientists-warn-factory-farming-raises-future-pandemic-risk-COVID-19-could-be-a-dress-rehearsal). It is also my personal concern that meat farming is an ethical pollutant. Western societies at large are familiar with the moral shortcomings of beating and consuming a dog's flesh. Yet this same kindness is not extended to other mammals for arbitrary reasons. Who can watch this: [https://youtu.be/dvtVkNofcq8](https://youtu.be/dvtVkNofcq8), and claim it is not animal abuse?

And another reason governments should reduce their populous meat consumption is because the [UN has called for it, citing our planet's relationship with meat as catastrophic.](https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/tackling-worlds-most-urgent-problem-meat) And the UN has demanded progressive changes at an economic level.

Encouraging the consumptive middle/upper class to go vegan will have a net positive effect on the planet. Veganism is not for the working class necessarily or even the sandal wearing un-showered hippies (like myself), but for our grandkids and their grandkids. And obviously for the animals. If we can believe in greener climate initiatives and productive healthcare programs, plant based diets should be factored in as a part of that.

A vegan diet is [healthy](https://www.nhs.uk/live-well/eat-well/the-vegan-diet/) even for [children as well](https://www.health.harvard.edu/blog/what-parents-need-to-know-about-a-vegan-diet-2020010718625), sustainable too. In fact it's the ['single biggest way'](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/veganism-environmental-impact-planet-reduced-plant-based-diet-humans-study-a8378631.html) to reduce your environmental impact on earth as an individual. [Meat farming requires more water,](https://www.sustain.ucla.edu/food-systems/the-case-for-plant-based/) more land and more blood despite not providing as much of our protein or caloric intake as plants do. (Source: [https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6392/987)).

Economic change will drive this shift the most and charity organisations like Refarm'd recognise that as they transition dairy farmers to oat milk farming. Governments should take on initiatives like Refarm'd or that of the Green Dot Program in Germany which encourage greener behaviours for the safeguarding of our planet. Why not adapt a Green Dot Program that incentivises consumers to greener food?

I also suggest that governments and corporations pay 50% each towards $100 for an employee of the paying corporation that maintains a vegan diet for 6 months. Perhaps they could measure one's veganism by testing their blood for crazy amounts of chlorophyll or 24/7 surveillance so that they do not touch one hamburger. (just to be clear /s, you can't get chlorophyll in your blood...that I know of...maybe if you're poison ivy).

I feel our time would be best used debating the principle of this idea rather than the execution of it. A lot of you are from different countries with different systems and as much as I love pedantry, we could get lost in the tangling weeds of semantics. How would X government implement Y in a caustic societal time like now because of Z is fun but my argument is simply put as:

plant based diet > meat based diet.

If you are so inclined to know, a genuine systemic change I would encourage at a government level is implementing plant based school meals for kids. Ideally making the majority of food options available to school children plant based.

So I posit that plant based diets should be encouraged on a societal level and they should be further industrialised.

I love this subreddit and I'm delighted by the opportunity to discuss this with you all, thank you for your time.

&#x200B;

TL;DR - Do we as a society aim to reduce suffering and prolong the planet's sustainability? If so, a plant based diet should be prioritised over a meat based diet and thus encouraged at a societal and government level.  
  
  

I've had a lot of fun and thank you all for
participating. I'm a bit too burnt out to keep going but I'd like to say thanks and detail the ways in which I have changed my view.  
  
I consider now that taking away subsidies from meat could even the playing field. And that certain lands and crops are not suitable for plant based farming and thus the greener option is not necessarily vegan. I may have my personal qualms ethically but I am privileged to have such qualms.  
  
Thank you all again, I hope to return to this sub soon. Hopefully I can one day earn a delta, until then clearly I have a lot to learn."	1	
t3_20veop	"The world is at no risk of becoming overpopulated, and talking about it is a distraction from the real issues (not the other way around). CMV"	"If fertility rates were to remain the same, population growth is driven by exponential growth (as pointed out by David Suzuki here http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8x98KFcMJeo) but the fertility rate hasn't remained constant. The rate of population increase has actually been quite linear over the past century (the 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th billion all came at approximately the same time apart, but exponetial growth says they should come closer together). It's been declining since the 1960s, not because of overpopulation alarmism, but just due to changing lifestyles as women have entered the workforce. In most western countries the fertility rate is below replacement now, and as other countries develop it also goes down. Bangladesh is often held up as the example of too many people, with images of Dhaka being the posters for the idea of overpopulation, but it has a fertility rate of 2.2 children per woman, which is only slightly above replacement (and possibly below).

Indeed, the UN thinks population will peak at 9 billion, and not because of food shortages or other factors relating to an ""overshoot"", but a gentle decline. Hans Rosling (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mz_kn45qIvI) thinks 12 Billion. This is with nobody feeling like they need to give up their dreams of big families for the sake of the planet, or anyone's rights being impinged upon; this is just what happens when well educated people, particularly women, have many ways of finding happiness in free societies.

What would life be like for 12 Billion people? Well we make enough food today for 10 billion, and we aren't making the best use of agricultural land by a long margin. We have the technology, now, to grow food and get clean water using solar energy in arid areas (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater_greenhouse). That's without burning any fossil fuels, and there are many ways of meeting other needs such as energy, building material and transport that don't contribute to CO2 emissions or other environmental problems with current technology. Housing room is the least of our worries - we've got more than enough room even if we live at low population densities (http://blog.chron.com/sciguy/2013/06/if-all-the-world-lived-in-houston-how-big-would-the-city-be/) - a very far cry from ""standing room only"". I'd say life could easily be as good as it is now, and life's probably as good as its ever been.

The real issues seem to be poor wealth distribution, corruption, education etc.; the issues that people say are a distraction from the main event which is overpopulation.

Malthus thought we'd run out of food, but he didn't predict the industrial revolution. Paul Ehrlich's bomb never went off, yet those views are held in high regard. But I'm always going to be worried when my main allies are the Population Research Institute, an anti-abortion organisation run by a religious body, so please, either CMV or affirm that I'm not falling into some ideological trap."	1	f

So not only are you being left with a nasty histamine reaction to the bite, but you are also possibly contracting malaria or other tropical diseases. 

Humanity has driven many species to extinction, and will only continue to based on our overall indifference towards environmental issues. However, this pest in mosquitoes continue to be a menace to humanity and other wildlife. As such, I feel we should use our extinction capabilities to obliterate them from Earth's ecosystems entirely. 

I doubt they will be missed. Sure, species of amphibians, fish, and birds may lose one food source, but I have never heard of a species whose insect-based diet is entirely mosquitoes. I also know humans have hijacked mosquitoes disease spreading capability to combat disease spread. Those are cool and all, but do they counterbalance the harms mosquitoes cause? There is no reason we can't eradicate this pest for good.

t3_3mn2r2	CMV: Reducing meat intake is the most important thing we can do to help the environment	"I watched Cowspiracy on Netflix recently and it really changed my perception on eating meat. 

Firstly let me say that I am not vegan or vegetarian, I eat meat pretty much every day and am not swayed by arguments about animal cruelty or living conditions etc... 

However, the documentary made a lot of good points regarding the impact that eating meat the way we do has on our environment.

- Animal agriculture is responsible for 18 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, more than the combined exhaust from all transportation. 
- 5% of water consumed in the US is by private homes. 55% of water consumed in the US is for animal agriculture.
- 2,500 gallons of water are needed to produce 1 pound of beef.
- Animal agriculture is the leading cause of species extinction, ocean dead zones, water pollution, and habitat destruction.
- 3/4 of the world’s fisheries are exploited or depleted.
- Animal Agriculture is the number 1 reason for deforestation.
- More than 5 times the amount of forest has been clear for animal agriculture than palm oil
- Ten thousand years ago, 99% of biomass (i.e. zoomass) was wild animals. Today, humans and the animals that we raise as food make up 98% of the zoomass.
- 1.5 acres can produce 37,000 pounds of plant-based food Vs. 375 pounds of meat

Source: http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts/

I have really been swayed by this documentary to reduce the amount of meat I eat (the documentary advocates a vegan diet, but I don't think I can cut out meat and dairy completely). I'm wary that I'm getting all this information from one place and what to hear what counter arguments there are. 

TL;DR: 

The human population is just too big to eat meat in the quantities we do, and if we cut our meat consumption in half we would benefit the environment more than any of our current efforts.

t3_1fnufx	"I am anthropocentric, meaning that my end goal in life is the well-being of humanity, and this should not be slowed down by animal rights. CMV"	"This is a response to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1fn725/i_feel_that_animals_should_be_treated_equally_to/) post, and I was hoping to offer an opposite viewpoint. I've had this argument with some of my environmentalist and vegetarian friends, though I was hoping to find more compelling arguments here.

My basic argument is that plants and animals are not self-aware. They cannot have dreams and aspirations like we do, and cannot strive to be self-actualized like humans can. They can only fulfill the base (and I suppose some could argue the second or even third) level of [Maslow's hierarchy of needs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs). So because of this, I say we grant animals, lets say a chicken, everything it needs to fulfill those requirements. However, chickens will never live long enough to actually change the world or become self-actualized, so what's the problem with slaughtering them earlier in life if it benefits humanity?

My friend says he wishes farmers would allow their chickens to live long, ""fulfilling"" lives, because chickens can live five times longer than what we allow them to. But if this farmer allows his chickens to live five times longer, he's making five times less money, and will surely go out of business. If we enacted laws like this, thousands of people would lose their jobs because chicken farming would not be lucrative anymore. Is that really worth letting chickens walk around doing nothing for a little longer? This farmer could have had dreams and aspirations, and now he's broke and on the street because of so-called ""animal rights"".

My friend also says that anthropocentrism is bad for the environment, but I think he confuses Anthropocentrism vs Biocentrism with Stupid Anthropocentrism vs Smart Anthropocentrism. For example, a stupid anthropocentrist would cut down all the trees because he wants wood to build a house, then would die from the floods and mudslides that would come because of the lack of roots absorbing the water from the dirt and holding the earth in place. A smart anthropocentrist would do his research and see that problem beforehand, then only cut down an acceptable number of trees and replant the ones he cut down so the environment sustains.

It just seems that some people think I can't possibly care about the environment if I put the needs of humans as my first priority. Saving the environment with selfish reasons is just as effective as any other method, just less direct. People *will* do their part for the environment once they see how it affects them, we just haven't really got there yet. For example, in the past 50 years, the amount of smokers in Canada has drastically decreased, because of a 3-step thought process:

1. Smoking cigarettes can give you cancer.
2. Cancer is bad.
3. Therefore, don't smoke cigarettes.

It's only a slightly more complicated thought-process to reduce our carbon emissions for selfish reasons:

1. Carbon and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere can trigger climate change.
2. Climate change can result in an increase in environmental disasters such as tsunamis and hurricanes.
3. Tsunamis and hurricanes are bad.
4. Therefore, we should reduce our carbon and greenhouse gas emissions.

So clearly, it's a bit more complicated than the first one, but environmental science has only really been a major discipline since the 1960s, so it's only a matter of time before more people see the environment as an issue that really affects humans. We don't need to be ""biocentric"" to see that protecting the environment is an important issue. We're a selfish species, and that's okay. Please change my view."	1	f
t3_frmx56	"CMV: In a first world country, if there is poverty, it's the government's fault."	"I think if the first-world cared about eradicating poverty, it would be gone by now (within itself.) There are massive inequalities within the US for example that will only widen since with capitalism money trickles up. You can think of this as corporate profits and the like. No one with the exception of maybe Tesla starts a business to intentionally lose money (without government intervention, money trickles up.)

First world countries should have enough material wealth to ensure that the poor have a comfortable lifestyle without truly jeopardizing what it means to be rich. Outside of radical societal change (like a revolution) it should be the government to ensure the best for its people.

First world countries still contain people trapped in poverty thus the government is not functioning well or at all. If something is deemed critical, the countries will find a way to proceed regardless of what it takes, like fighting some proxy-war in the middle-east or enacting regime change.

Poverty exists because people who are within the position to tackle such an issue don't care enough. This doesn't mean solving poverty for the entire world, but at least within its own borders.  

It's not up to the poor people to suddenly get rich or uplift themselves out of poverty through hard work.  This might be true on an individual basis, but I don't think it can be true on a societal scale."	1	f

"Firstly, I am not a Communist, and I am not advocating a Trotsky-style revolution or a complete upheaval of western democracy. However, I do feel that a right wing Conservative ideology is not capable of combating global poverty, and that a Socialist government is the only way forward. 

Firstly, higher tax rates for large corporations would redistribute wealth in society, without greatly affecting the rich individuals in question. I also feel more money should be spent on foreign aid, especially in the form of small business support in Africa, for example. 

Finally, in terms of domestic policy, I would support a mansion tax for properties where there are more than 2 bedrooms not in use by current residents.

All of the above policy ideas are left-leaning, hence my point that a right wing government could not, and would not implement them. This is why I argue that Socialism is the way forward to destroy poverty. I currently live in the UK, if that makes a difference.

t3_p833ga	CMV: I should support Nuclear energy over Solar power at every opportunity.	"Nuclear energy is cheap, abundant, clean, and safe. It can be used industrially for manufacturing while solar cannot. And when people say we should be focusing on all, I see that as just people not investing all we can in Nuclear energy. 

There is a roadmap to achieve vast majority of your nation's energy needs. France has been getting 70% or their electricity from generations old Nuclear power plants.

Solar are very variable. I've read the estimates that they can only produce energy in adequate conditions 10%-30% of the time. 

There is a serious question of storing the energy. The energy grid is threatened by too much peak energy. And while I think it's generally a good think to do to install on your personal residence. I have much more reservations for Solar farms. 

The land they need are massive. You would need more than 3 million solar panels to produce the same amount of power as a typical commercial reactor. 

The land needs be cleared, indigenous animals cleared off. To make way for this diluted source of energy? If only Nuclear could have these massive tradeoffs and have the approval rating of 85%.

It can be good fit on some very particular locations. In my country of Australia, the outback is massive, largely inhabitable, and very arid. 

Singapore has already signed a deal to see they get 20% of their energy from a massive solar farm in development. 

I support this for my country. In these conditions, though the local indigenous people on the land they use might not. 

I think it's criminal any Solar farms would be considered for arable, scenic land. Experts say there is no plan to deal with solar panels when they reach their life expectancy. And they will be likely shipped off to be broken down, and have their toxins exposed to some poor African nation. 

I will not go on about the potential of Nuclear Fusion, or just using Thorium. Because I believe entirely in current generation Nuclear power plants. In their efficiency, safety and cost-effectiveness. 

Germany has shifted from Nuclear to renewables. Their energy prices have risen by 50% since then. Their power costs twice as much as it does for the French. 

The entirety of people who have died in accidents related to Nuclear energy is 200. Chernobyl resulted from extremely negligent Soviet Union safety standards that would have never happened in the western world. 31 people died. 

Green mile island caused no injuries or deaths. And the radioactivity exposed was no less than what you would get by having a chest x-ray. 

Fukushima was the result of a tsunami and earthquake of a generations old reactor. The Japanese nation shut down usage of all nuclear plants and retrofitted them to prevent even old nuclear plants suffering the same fate.

I wish the problems with solar panels improve dramatically. Because obviously we aren't moving towards the pragmatic Nuclear option. 

I don't see the arguments against it. That some select plants are over-budget? The expertise and supply chain were left abandoned and went to other industries for a very long time.

t3_5eie3m	"CMV: In attempting to be neutral and present both sides of an idea or issue, the media actually creates false equivalencies which misleads the public into believing the two sides are equal."	"I'm a firm believer that the media over represented Trump leading up to the election in an effort to appear balanced and neutral. This often meant twisting and skewing Trump's (lack of) rhetoric to make it seem of equal validity to the policy proposed by Clinton.

But they are not equal.

Clinton clearly outlined the exact steps of her plans, and what she wanted to do on a given issue. Trump either didn't present a policy (ISIS, Aleppo), or presented a rhetoric based entirely on vague (MAGA), or blatantly false (Climate change is a hoax) pretense.

This actually causes the media to be *less* neutral by giving undeserved credence to Trump's platform, but comparing it as equal to Clinton's.

There are other issues where the media does the same thing by bringing in a dissenting view on issues that have been factually proven and concluded. In other words, there is no rational dissenting view for:

* Climate change is caused by humans.

* The Earth was created billions of years ago, not thousands.

* No race is intellectually superior to another.

This perpetuation of false equivalencies misleads the public into thinking that two things are equal and opposite, as opposed to unequal.

t3_8bd1ge	CMV: Nuclear energy is *by far* the best form of power generation currently available to humans	"First, let me outline why i think it is better than other sources

Cost: nuclear, coal, oil and hydro-electric are all fairly similar in price around the globe, and are tied for the cheapest forms of energy we have. Other renewables such as wind and solar are much more expensive alternatives.

Emissions: nuclear does not emit CO2 like coal and oil do, and therefore would be very helpful in the fight against climate change.

Pollution: Nuclear energy does not emit harmful chemicals into the air, unlike coal and oil, and therefore would keep the air fairly clean.

Doesn’t kill birds: wind farms do that, a lot.

Physical size: nuclear reactors, compared to the amount of energy they output, take up very little physical space. This is in direct contrast to wind farms mostly, but also solar farms. This is important because it means a)humans have more space to do more stuff, and b) because the environment and wildlife will be able to do better with humans taking up less land.

Doesn’t destroy river ecosystems: hydro-electric dams do that.

Not geographically bound: nuclear reactors can be built almost anywhere. Only coal and oil share this convenience. All others such as hydro-electric, geothermal, solar or wind have to be built on a major river, in a high geothermal activity area, in a desert/high solar area or in a very windy area respectively.

Continuous: nuclear power can constantly output power which eliminates the need for a secondary source of power when the wind dies out or the sky gets cloudy.

Kills very few people: now I know what you’re thinking, but what about like Chernobyl and stuff? Well the answer is that even in Chernobyl which was a very poorly contained and engineered reactor which was run by the Russians only a few thousand people died. And when you add all the deaths of all the nuclear meltdowns and all the radiation deaths that came from them then divide that by the amount of power outputted by nuclear reactors you get the amount of people that die per unit of energy produced. When you calculate this number for each energy source you find that nuclear actually kills the fewest people per unit of power produced of any energy source we know of. This means that nuclear is actually the safest power source that there is.

Now, let me refute a couple common points

But like what about that nuclear winter thing??
well if you run the numbers you will quickly find that to have even an inkling of a nuclear winter you would require at least around 50 nuclear missiles to be detonated simultaneously. Not even considering the fact that nuclear power plants don’t explode (they melt down) it would require an absurd amount of nuclear reactors to go boom over a very short amount of time to create a nuclear winter.

How can we trust, like, Iran and stuff to not make nukes with their reactors??:
Well I mean we could always just not give them the reactor and simply export electricity to them from some other trustworthy country, but i think that answer is lacking. The real answer is in the form of thorium reactors. Thorium reactors are exactly what they sound like, they’re nuclear reactors that instead of using uranium/plutonium they use thorium. Thorium has all the advantages of regular nuclear reactors, however, it cannot be made into a bomb and would therefore be safe to give to nations like Iran and others.

Well, that’s about it I think. Did I miss anything?

t3_4jlw6g	"CMV: US culture has fetishized non-violence, to our detriment"	"I do not believe non-violent protest will solve any of the problems the US faces today. We are not dealing with enemies who think we are inferior beings and need to be shown our humanity; we are dealing with corrupt and ideologically evil rulers who are above the law. The methods that worked for MLK will not work against these people.

I want to refer to three specific groups: law enforcement, ""the 1%"", and the government. 

Although police brutality has largely faded from the public eye, the past few years have shown us very alarming things regarding law enforcement. Those with complaints of excessive use of force filed against them are rarely punished. They are too quick to pull and use guns against the unarmed, against children, and against pets. Police departments investigate their own and find their own to be blameless. Fellow officers lie to protect their colleagues from legal repurcussions. Civil forfeiture still runs rampant, where people who are charged with no crimes are robbed. Hiding behind a political shield of ""our job is tough and dangerous, leave us alone,"" it is incredibly difficult to pass reforms. In my view, the only way to keep corrupt cops off the street, to protect the public from them, is to kill them.

The 1% view us as sheep or as fodder to keep their profits rolling in. They buy politicians, write laws that favor them, and using bill-mills like ALEC, spread their influence to the State and local levels. So long as they are in charge, the middle class and poor will continue to suffer economically crippling events: low minimum wages/automation, environmental disasters, more free trade deals. Corporations like Nestle will continue profiting from water harvested from states crippled by drought. The Kochs and Exxon will continue ramming fossil fuels down our throats and denying climate change even though the entire planet suffers for their greed. These people do not care about us or about anyone. For the good of humankind, I believe these people need to be eliminated.

Our government, from the state level to the senate, are systemically corrupted and bow to interests who are ruining the lives and livelihoods of everyday citizens, and people around the world. Take for example the Flint water crisis. This was a cost-saving measure. Red flags were raised, alarms were sounded. An engineer working on the project demanded more time to prevent the issue and was ignored. Emergency managers were removed and replaced with the governor's own appointees. This was preventable, the crime is extreme, and evidence points to Snyder knowing exactly what he was doing. He remains in power while THREE people involved in lawsuits against him are coincidentally dead. 

These people are above the law, these people write the laws. Yelling ""shame! shame!"" at them isn't going to do shit. The only logical recourse for the public is to get rid of them, permanently. CMV.

t3_av019l	CMV: Millennials have to fix the world and have every right to be angry at the older generations.	"Millennials have been given a huge task by older generations and the sooner they are elected to positions of power the sooner they can fix the problems that these generations have made.

 In order to fix the climate Millennials will have to travel less, consume less and pay more for the privilege. This is on top of being poorer than the generation directly above, sky rocketing costs and growing inequality, and then we have to pay even more tax just to keep the people who created this awful self serving system alive for a few more decades and give them spending money. To deal with all this and expected to respect their elders (while they write articles about how Millennials are causing all the modern problems) is a disgusting position, especially when they have had decades to actually start fixing the issues and have instead focused on getting rich.

Lets look at the ageing population issue, people are living longer and because of the baby boom there are now more of them than ever. These people were given really amazing retirement packages back when people died young. Now that governments have realised that this is unsustainable they are making pensions worse and harder to get by extending the retirement age over and over. Also they realise that the health care for this group is going to be massive, just to have enough workers to look after them we need mass immigration but it turns out that they don't like this either. So the only thing that will work is more and more public money going to health care at a higher tax rate. This burden is falling on millennials when they should have upped there own taxes invested in public health care while they were earning to be ready to look after them selves when they were old. 

Climate change is a massive problem and it has been known about for decades but instead of implementing massive recycling schemes and emission cutting in the 90s or even the early 2000s so it could change slowly over they pushed it back since they like consumption and now we only have 20 years to save the world which means huge and dramatic changes effecting the quality of life for the next 30+ years.

These are just 2 issues being caused by older generations but they effect how millennials will live for the rest of their lives. They are clearly unwilling to change so we have to get in to power and fix this for the next generations."	1	f

# CMV: The Amazon rainforest is too  integral to the health of the planet for individual nations to be guardian. The  Amazon should be entrusted to a global guardianship, a combo of high  level forest management, and military protection to ensure its  persistence and health.

I think it is well established that the Amazon rainforest is integral to the health of the planet, as a carbon graveyard and heat sink; home to stunning biodiversity and cultural heritage; its loss would have unimaginably harmful global impacts.

Its survival is our survival, and a multinational coalition should step up to protect it and take guardianship, hopefully with cooperation of government (the idea being the execution of economic sanctions and threat of military force from several powerful nations would sway even someone like Bolsinaro to cave). I think this works best spearheaded by the US, but would need purchase from several other major military and economic powers.


Response: Thanks to everyone who contributed, PatrickKelly2012 had the biggest impact on my thinking. seems that the Amazon is not as integral as I thought. I still think it is worth preserving at all costs, but see how military intervention would counter-productive. my hope is that an international movement coalesces to and uses all non-violent means to protect all of the earth's biosphere, especially the ocean and the oldest forests.

"I was raised in a Christian-ish home, but over the years (and after extensive collegiate studies in Philosophy) I can no longer bring myself to believe in a God that plays any sort of role in our existence here on earth. My personal belief is, at this point: 1) We don't know anything about the existence of a higher power. 2) I feel it would be rather audacious to believe that we are the end-all-be-all in terms of organisms- I think there is likely something far greater than we are (This mystical being is my ""god""). 3) Life is either a divine coincidence (unfathomable, to me) or a construction by some 'thing'.  

So, if someone presented you with the [Epicurean Paradox](http://i.imgur.com/Gqd0TLR.jpg) how would you argue against them?

I've heard some relatively good cases- but tbh, I can't remember their logic.

Thank you in advance!

**Here is some Wiki copypasta for the logical problem:**

If an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent god exists, then evil does not.

There is evil in the world.

Therefore, an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent god does not exist.


God exists.

God is omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent.

An omnibenevolent being would want to prevent all evils.

An omniscient being knows every way in which evils can come into existence.

An omnipotent being has the power to prevent that evil from coming into existence.

A being who knows every way in which an evil can come into existence, who is able to prevent that evil from coming into existence, and who wants to do so, would prevent the existence of that evil.

If there exists an omnipotent, omniscient, and omnibenevolent, then no evil exists.

Evil exists (logical contradiction)."	1

"I am a very big supporter of nuclear power and while I'll concede that the huge start up cost is a good reason to not start large scale nuclear power in America, my girlfriend brings up the point that we don't have places to store the nuclear waste. Which I disagree with. Nuclear bombs were and still are being tested in Nevada (as recently as 2014) and I just don't see why we can't fence of a 100 mile radius area in the desert in order to store the waste. Surely we could at least put the waste in the center of a drop site in order to reduce the impact to the environment.

Obviously it would fill up over time, but I feel like it would be a much better solution to our power needs than using our fossil fuels. 

My girlfriend argues that the impact to the environment could be more substantial than I think because ""we don't know what will happen"". Which is why I feel like the Nevada/Arizona desert would be perfect since putting the waste in these deserts minimizes any impact on the environment since not a lot of things grow there anyway (relatively). And even if we we neglected the environment we could also put them in northern very underpopulated areas in Northern Canada and Alaska and just hope the all the wild life moves from that area. To which I don't think is the best solution but as I've said before I think it's better than the current fossil fuel solution which is destroying our entire planet. 

This is also because I don't see solar or wind power as being viable options throughout the entire United States since the sun and wind aren't consistent enough throughout the country to provide ongoing power.

I believe that why this isn't happening already is because of the stigma behind nuclear power and the average person doesn't understand the difference between nuclear power and nuclear weapons so no governor will allow it in their state. So please try to change my view!

I believe it all comes down to boundaries society and ourselves have placed on us. 

Everyone should know I’m completely throwing the idea of what our current world is (a collection of societies formed to increase the likelihood of the species survival) out of the window. Instead I would like to look at the world as if our main goals were to maximize innovation where anyone could technically do anything and not have to worry about these societal boundaries. 

This world I’m thinking of is achievable only at the cost of what is societally acceptable, which could literally be everything you think you know is right.  In this world your opinion doesn’t matter unless they care, as taking in other’s opinions is something humans use to minimize conflict while still achieving a goal most people involved can be happy with. Yes, in this world evildoers could take over but only if they outperform the people who want to enhance the world, which I would assume is the vast majority of humans. This world doesn’t bar the existence of societies but rather instead of focusing on survival we channeled all of our energy into innovation to improve the world so much it would get to the point that our survival is guaranteed.

I’m not entirely serious about this argument as it was made from a thought I’ve been pondering on for about a week. Just looking to see the criticism it gets.

I'm also impatient at the slow pace at which action on climate change is happening.

As I see it, one of the main problems is that different countries have different regulations, and this leaves companies free to pick whichever place to operate that has the lowest standards. This is further complicated by the fact that even with great regulations on paper, many of them are subverted by loopholes, corruption, or simply a lack of enforcement. 

Therefore I have come to the conclusion that the best solution is regulations created at the global level and enforced by a global body, so there would be nowhere to hide. They would be strong (low emissions limits for example) and tight (requiring lots of testing on new products, no loopholes). I have in mind food, medicine and environment related regulations, although I can see applications for other things as well.

The other thing about growing up in a suburb that can be bad for a kid is boredom. In an urban area (assuming it's reasonably safe), you always have something to do. Seriously, the possibilities are practically endless. A suburban minor, however, does not have this luxury, and has just as much free time, but way less things to do. When someone is constantly bored, they learn to just be bored. They can deal with their boredom with lots of activities, but after a school day, it seems far more likely for an adolescent to do non-productive things, like watch TV, or get high.

Lately I have been thinking about my understanding of science and the way I know what I know about scientific subjects. Most of my knowledge about science comes from either high school or stuff I read on the internet in my free time. The problem that I saw with this is that I have little to no way of knowing for a fact that what I read is correct. I believe that a vast majority of people who use science as a way of understanding the world do not or can not read, understand and critically analyze the specific data and research that was used to prove that a certain scientific theory is correct. People might understand that the universe was formed by the big bang, that species form through natural selection, that the sun is about 150 million km away or whatever, but since they have not done the research themselves and since a large part of people do not know or understand *why* this is true they don't use proof to back up their way of thinking. Since people do not use proof but still claim that scientific theory x is correct, and since faith means believing something to be true without evidence, we could say that these people use faith as a major factor in their way of viewing the world. The difference is that it's not a religious faith but rather a faith in humanity, in nature and in science.

The carbon footprint of each child, especially those in the first world, is far greater than than of children in the third world. An extensive academic paper [here](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378008001003)

I have a few very simple points to make:

1. Why insist on having your biological child when so many are in need of a family? 
2. Why add to the rapid deterioration of our environment by bringing another human being into existence? 

In case anyone finds it relevant, i'm 30, female, no children, presumably fertile, raised by my biological family.

t3_6k44lk	"CMV: If humanity has a future, it must settle the cosmos."	"Humanity faces many threats on Earth, some of which have threatened our survival knowingly or unknowingly for thousands of years. In 1969, we proved that we have the ability to go to other worlds and survive and with the construction of the International Space Station we have proved we are able to survive living in space for over a year at a time with no gravity and exposure to higher levels of radiation. 

Earth, love her or hate her isn't going to last forever, much less with 7+ billion of us living on it already and with over 10 billion predicted by 2100; all of us living in ways that produce extreme amounts of waste, environmental impact and constantly competing for ever dwindling resources that will continue to deplete faster with our growing population. Population growth can lead to increased chances of disease, lack of food and other resources; some of these factors can lead to a less stable society which can lead to millions of deaths through violence, starvation and other means. 

Another threat looming over our world is random events such as asteroid collisions, gamma ray bursts, polar shifts, solar radiation storms ( the last two being more likely). We cannot predict these events nor prevent them with any reasonable confidence. 

Our world is also currently filled with millions of individuals that have dangerous ideologies that simply cannot be changed or phased out within a reasonable time frame. Examples include Neo Nazi's, KKK members or sympathizers, Radical Islamist extremists, westboro baptist church types etc. Those that hold these ideals and others like them often times wish the deaths of others for no reason other than their beliefs. A new society on other worlds could limit the spread of these ideologies by establishing their society on a basis where the society comes before any personal beliefs that any individual may have. Such a society does not exist in our world. The US for example, while attempting to be religion neutral has a powerful basis in christianity, with phrases commonly used such as ""In God we trust"" and the fact that homosexual marriage was not permitted for much of its history in favor of christian values. All of this being said, you CANNOT force people to believe what you want, and you shouldn't because that would inhibit free thinking and compromise values of freedom. Rather such a society on new worlds should encourage people to be inquisitive and to find evidence for the things they believe. For example, although people may believe that humans did not evolve from apes and were the creation of God, they should at minimum accept evolution as truth because of the evidence behind it or at the very least question the evidence of their own beliefs. I believe that doing so could potentially create a more stable society than anything we are currently capable of with existing populations on Earth who's minds cannot be changed easily and who pass on their ideologies to their children for generations. 

Earth's climate is also failing, and while i strongly support measures to save our planet i do not believe it should not prevent us from expanding to other worlds. Mars for example is an insanely inhospitable world, one that scientists would likely attempt to alter to make more habitable. I believe the research and technology done to make Mars more habitable can be used back here on Earth when the methods to do so are proven to work rather than dangerously experimenting with our only planets ecosystem. 

Lastly, this is more of a belief rather than an argument to support my thesis, but i believe that it would be ridiculous for humanity, the only sentient life in a universe billions of light years across with trillions of galaxy's stars and planets should forever be confined to a blue spec in a sunbeam doomed to live out its final days or moments violently never to be seen or heard from again because of it's own ignorance when the solution to our continued survival is insanely plentiful among the stars if only we had the willpower to do so. We have spent 4.6 billion years getting to where we are here, we shouldn't stop now ;)

t3_33539l	CMV: In 150 years people will have the same attitude toward eating animals as we do today toward keeping slaves.	"When someone tells a nice story about George Washington, or Thomas Jefferson, someone is always able to chime in and say ""Yeah, but he kept slaves, so fuck that guy"".  I think that in 150 years, people will have the same attitude about Martin Luther King, or JFK.  In the same way that we see ""But I had a farm to run"" as a terrible excuse for slavery, people will see ""But it's tough to get protein"" as a terrible excuse for killing and eating animals.  I don't think ""But it was different times, people didn't understand"" will be any more convincing about this issue in 150 years than it is today about slavery.

The reason I think this is a combination of several trends:

Ever more viable alternatives to meat.  People all over the world can now choose produce from all over the world, so it's a bit more easy to find a full range vegetable based meat alternatives.  Also, artificial meat seems like it will become a thing relatively soon.

Progressing attitudes towards animal welfare and intelligence will make it so that animals are seen as something more akin to non-human people with severally limited intelligence.

Things like global warming, and population growth will make a high meat a rarer commodity.

In short, we'll no longer need to, we'll no longer want to, and we'll no longer be able to.  And once that situation has been around for a long enough time, any sense of context or perspective about why it used to be okay to eat meat will have been lost, and it will seem as utterly barbaric as slavery seems today.

Some clarifiers:

1.  I'm not looking for a debate about whether it's okay to eat meat.  This is merely a dispassionate prediction about the future, and my view is that the prediction will come to pass, not that what I'm predicting is better or worse.

2.  I eat meat all the time (I'm not sure if it matters, but you might think it does).

3.  150 is a rough number.

4.  ""As bad as slavery"" is an approximation.

t3_6jx67p	CMV: Veganism is the only sustainable and ethically tenable diet plan in first world countries.	"Here's an analogy: We're in the not-so distant future where electric cars are as ubiquitous as normal automobiles, are cheaper on average, are easier and less wasteful to manufacture, and are just as reliable and capable.

 You would assume in this future that electric cars would be dominating the market, that the only people really clinging to buying gas cars are people who either are so used to cars that they can't be bothered to change or absolute idiots who buy into some kind of gas burning culture. You would assume that electric charging stations would be popping up all over.

This is the reality that we live in now with eating a vegan diet. It is just as easy to maintain, cheaper, just as efficient, and the ability to buy into it is absolutely ubiquitous. The only problems are in restaurants not catering to the diet in low income areas mostly and that is due to the culture surrounding the diet. It has absolutely nothing to do with the profitability and sustainability of serving vegan food. 

Decreasing animal factories would not only free up the land used for possible planting of crops for more food yield overall, it would free up the land that is being used to sustain those animals. World hunger would be curbed by ending meat consumption. 

These are views shared with vegans all the time, and the answer is met with ""it's a personal choice, don't force your views on me."" Yet we don't allow smoking indoors, we provide recycling bins for people and will fine for littering, we constantly are not supporting acts that will destroy health/environment yet for food it is somehow different. 

Somehow food is so ingrained in our culture that you somehow change your identity based on your diet. And it's irrational. 

Sure, veganism should be a choice. But it should be seen as the only logical and ethical choice of diet among citizens.

t3_nrkx0u	CMV: Everyone should at the very least seriously consider adding insects to their diet.	"If vegans and the rest of us consumed more insects in our diets, the reduction in animal suffering would be far larger when you consider the amount of sentient animal suffering done to make all the agriculture fields for edible vegetables.

Insects also have the higher density of protein even when compared to plants or meat.

Insects can be grown year round with as many harvest as one would like if raised in a controlled building and are far more resilient depending species for many climates.

The environmental impact in reduction in use of water and release of methane would be much the same as going vegan if an Omnivore were to replace all meat with insects.

t3_1x8fy5	Neil deGrasse Tyson is not a scientist. CMV.	"Caveat: I think NdGT is doing great things. We live in an era of poor scientific literacy and engagement. Anyone who fights to change that is doing good work. 

Main Argument: Scientists are people who do science. I actually have a fairly broad definition of this. Doing science is about creating knowledge. Creating knowledge may involve laboratory work, observational methods, theoretical musings, etc. I don't care if you work at a university, in a corporate lab, or in your garage. However, creating knowledge also involves engaging the scientific community about your new findings through conference presentations or publication in scientific journals. 

To the best of my knowledge, NdGT does not do science. He neither creates knowledge nor participates in any accepted form of peer reviewed scientific discourse. 

NdGT is a science writer (he writes about science). NdGT is a science PR rep extraordinaire. But, he's not a scientist. 

Anticipated rebuttal: Yes I understand NdGT holds a PhD in astrophysics. But I don't think a credential alone is enough to qualify one as a scientist. I could have a PhD in music; that wouldn't make me a musician. NdGT probably had to be a scientist to finish his dissertation, but I don't think he is one anymore.  "	1	f
t3_f8isbw	"CMV: Bernie Sander's heart may be in the right place, but he is a terribly misguided candidate. His policies make very little sense, and would only serve to make America worse."	" At one point in time, I thought that Bernie was the best presidential candidate. I thought that he just wanted to implement the common sense policies already implemented in Scandinavia and the rest of the developed world. However, I quickly found out that this wasn't the case and that most of Bernie's policies are economically harmful and not implemented in the rest of the developed world. In fact, the very few policies he wants to implement, that are present in places like Europe, like free college tuition are regressive and economically harmful.

He's against the huge economic consensus in areas like trade, rent control, taxation, free college, etc. Also details are everything when it comes to a healthcare plan (just cause it's universal doesn't mean anything). His single payer healthcare plan is more extreme (thus more expensive) than other healthcare programs in Europe, and is considered terrible by actual healthcare economists ( [https://i.redd.it/ac52lm7zm9i41.jpg](https://i.redd.it/ac52lm7zm9i41.jpg)). Furthermore, Bernie has essentially zero understanding of the financial system of the country, wants to implement a financial transactions tax (especially at his rate), and wants to implement a regressive and economically harmful free college policy. I can go on but I'll stop since this post is already long, I'll just send some links supporting my claims on rent control and free college tuition (if you want I can send sources for all of my claims). In addition, I will send some miscellaneous links.

**Rent Control:**

Poll of economists from top universities in the country:

Literature review from an economist specializing in the sub field:

[https://data.nber.org/reporter/2009number2/gyourko.html](https://data.nber.org/reporter/2009number2/gyourko.html)

This is also one of the best comments that I've seen that summarizes a list of well sourced rebuttals to most of Sander's policies:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/eu5hoj/a\_critique\_of\_sanders\_economic\_policies/ffmrdwh/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/neoliberal/comments/eu5hoj/a_critique_of_sanders_economic_policies/ffmrdwh/?context=3)

**Free College Tuition:**

I'll first cite the economic consensus on free college tuition. Here's a link. [https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/26/468298576/economists-on-candidates-proposals-mostly-bad](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2016/02/26/468298576/economists-on-candidates-proposals-mostly-bad)

So mainly the issue is that most of the people that attend college are upper middle to upper class ( [http://www.higheredtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/low-income-data-point-12.png](http://www.higheredtoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/low-income-data-point-12.png) ). I think that it's economically inefficient to give these people free rides.

You might be thinking what will happen to the marginal students that aren't in the middle or upper class. Research shows that there will be a negligible net benefit to them as ""such students are far more likely to drop out of college or become underemployed even with a four-year degree, implying only small wage gains from college education"" ( [https://www.nber.org/papers/w21724](https://www.nber.org/papers/w21724) ).

Thus, free college will overwhelmingly benefit the middle and upper class (who already have the financial means to pay for their education). [https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-would-benefit-most-from-free-college/](https://www.brookings.edu/research/who-would-benefit-most-from-free-college/)

This is why free college tuition is an economically inefficient and regressive policy. Lastly, college isn't the only path forward. There are plenty of opportunities like trade schools and apprenticeships that can lead to lucrative careers. Bernie is just ignoring this.

Climate Change:

First: [https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/08/30/bernie-sanders-climate-plan-nuclear-phase-out-attacks](https://www.desmogblog.com/2019/08/30/bernie-sanders-climate-plan-nuclear-phase-out-attacks)

Bernie Sander's climate change policy is just atrocious. Contrary to what he may think, wind and solar cannot fill the gap left by fossil fuels, nuclear is necessary. Currently, wind turbines and solar panel are actually far more expensive than nuclear reactors when you take into account the opportunity cost of the fact that wind and solar uses a lot more land that could have been used for literally anything else, because low efficiency would need us to build more of them. In fact, wind energy uses over 360 times ([https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants](https://www.nei.org/news/2015/land-needs-for-wind-solar-dwarf-nuclear-plants)) more land than nuclear, while solar uses even more. Land that could have been used for agriculture, housing, and literally anything else. If we wanted to power the US though solely wind, we would need to cover the entire coastline in turbines, and a large portion of the great plains in solar panels for full solar. Modern nuclear reactors are extremely safe, and it is literally impossible for Chernobyl to happen again, because our reactors are completely different by design.

Nuclear waste isn't as bad as you think it is. That's a popular misconception. Currently, what we do is contain them safely and cheaply in metal containers, then bury them under a mountain in Nevada, so there is no harm done. Edit: Also this: [https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/coal-ash-is-more-radioactive-than-nuclear-waste/)

Also, there are new reactor types coming out called thorium reactors than can use spent nuclear fuel. We need to invest in them.

US actually has 98 nuclear reactors. You have to realize that those 98 reactors provide over 20% of the nation's power, which is actually kind of insane if you think about it. A single nuclear reactor generates more than 2000 wind turbines worth of energy. Nuclear energy is the only option we have that can out produce coal and other fossil fuels safely and cleanly. Nuclear energy is worth the cost.

First of all, it is basically implies that the world cannot take collective action via the UN without the approval of these 5 countries:

1- Why these 5? They're not there because of population, human rights record, size of its economy, or effective policies that keep the peace. They're there, essentially, by chance.

2- Why does everything have to depend on them? The idea that the UN, in representation of the international community, cannot take action if one of these 5 randomly ""selected"" governments doesn't agree is simply non-sensical. Why do they have that privilidge, why are they so special? 

3- Some might even say it's an imperialist attitude, the idea that the world cannot collectively take action unless a particular country, who got the veto privilidge thanks to military strength, doesn't agree.

t3_6azqg0	"CMV: Philosophy as made by philosophers is unreliable for living life and for public policy, except as an artistic diversion."	"Philosophy is generally not very useful in real life. People make lots of theories about the world and how stuff works and get paid to make such theories. Lots of figures like Foucault, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Bertrand Russel, Husserl, Sartre, Derrida, Heidegger, spent lots of time writing and theorizing about how the world and language and such works.

Most of their theories are abstruse, semantical, and often oppressive to people. Political theories with minimal connection to the real world, abstract ideals about morals and such. 

The exception are more mathematical philosophies and logics of the sort that are entirely beyond the common man's ability to comprehend, like what Betrand Russel the mathematician does or Ludwig Wittgenstein the engineer's work on mathematical logic. There's certainly value to a super pure logical or mathematical philosophy.

But outside the work of people who were generally not mostly trained philosophers and who were doing pure maths, it's not especially useful or practical as to stuff in the real world.

That's not to say that philosophy can never be right or useful, but I haven't seen much evidence that knowledge specifically from the field of philosophy (outside of maths) is more useful than, say, advice from your old aunt, or from a drunk fellow at the pub, or from your horoscope. It's not reliably useful.

Data driven approaches are better for real world things, based on statistics. 

I also know that many people find philosophy enjoyable, like reading a good book, but I don't see that as a reliable use- based on philosophy. It's more based on the charisma of the writer or your curiosity than any practical knowledge. 

Evidence that will change my view include evidence that philosophy learning produces a general increase in some measurable thing, or that talking and thinking about things has provided a generally better approach than statistics and data about the past, or that there are valuable discoveries that matter for the average person outside mathematics that have been made in recent or distant times.

Evidence that won't change my view will be stuff about how inspiring the writing is or about how mathematical logic is awesome or how about non philosophers have cool ideas.

I want my view changed because a lot of people have clearly devoted a lot of effort to this, and I'd like there to be some clear tangible benefit to their efforts.


Also, that effective altruism, developed by Peter Singer and Kant that led to over a 1000 people and over 100 million dollars being sent to save lives which is a large and powerful impact directly from philosophy.

t3_hcuof3	CMV: Preventing catastrophic environmental destruction and maintaining capitalism are incompatible objectives.	"Climate change isn't a mere coincidence of our discovery and overuse of fossil fuels. Environmental destruction, one way or the other, is the inescapable result of the capitalist system. Setting aside any other externalities and inequities associated with capitalism, every single bit of value will be taken out of the earth's resources to the fullest extent possible, as demanded by the ""grow or die"" imperative. Therefore, we cannot just blame the Koch brothers, the oil and gas companies, the businesses that are doing it ""wrong"" for climate change and environmental destruction. They aren't *necessarily* inherently evil, they are acting as they must to succeed within the system as it exists. So in order to prevent environmental disaster, the system must be changed.

Believing that technology and innovation will save us is just wishful thinking. Even if renewable energy and carbon capture manage to prevent the worst of climate change, the growth imperative demands that as much value be extracted from natural resources as possible. We already see the devastation caused by lithium mining for electric car batteries.

I believe that the appropriate structure of society would be a decentralized confederation of communal municipalities (see Murray Bookchin). I think that such a society would be able to sustainably avoid environmental destruction. But I am more interested in hearing from supporters of capitalism how they reckon environmental destruction can be avoided under a system that demands ""grow or die.""

t3_1nfpex	I think we require an immediate program of global geoengineering to prevent extinction of life on Earth. CMV.	"In his book, ""Storms of my Grandchildren"", James Hansen explains why a ""Venus effect"" on Earth as a result of human greenhouse gas emissions can not be eliminated from the realm of probabilities.

[Quote:](http://www.sindark.com/2010/02/04/is-runaway-climate-change-possible-hansens-take/)






This would lead to the eventual extinction of all life on Earth and the death of the biosphere, as humans reveal themselves to be a species capable of overriding the negative feedback loops that have until now protected the Earth against a ""Venus syndrome"".

**Why Geoengineering?**

Despite the insistence of most environmentalists, I don't believe the economy is ready for a shift to non carbon based fuels. The evidence for this is simple, namely the fact that fossil fuels are still used. If renewable energy sources were economically more efficient, we would use them on a broader scale. We also face the problem that the shift has to be very rapid.

[This graph illustrates the maximum yearly decline in CO2 emissions if we wish to have a 67% chance of staying beneath 2 degrees.](http://i.imgur.com/suGaYWi.png) If you look at this, you notice that a peak in emissions in 2015 means that we will have a maximum yearly CO2 emissions reduction of 5.3% a year. We already failed the 2011 peak target, which would have allowed a maximum 3.7% yearly reduction.

Now, if we take this ambitious goal of a peak decline of 5.3% a year in CO2 emissions, it's reasonable to conclude that oil consumption would have to decline by 5.3% a year as well. In reality, oil would likely have to decline faster, because new unconventional oil sources will be more CO2 intensive than current sources.

[The IMF predicts that a yearly decline in oil production of 2% would wreak havoc on the global economy.](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2012/10/27/imf-study-peak-oil-could-do-serious-damage-to-the-global-economy/) [A lot of scientists are now suggesting that 450ppm is probably unrealistic, and the best we can hope for is 550.](http://belfercenter.ksg.harvard.edu/files/BlanfordTwoPager.pdf)

Note that we are still dealing with a 67% chance of staying beneath two degrees. If the models are too conservative, and some positive feedback loop shows up earlier than we expected (example: The Arctic ice declines faster than we expected, the Amazon rainforest is more vulnerable than we thought, etcera), we'll still move above 2 degrees and lose control.

Therefore, my conclusion is that current goals are completely unrealistic. We think that we are capable of reducing CO2 emissions at a pace that would destroy the global economy, with a 33% chance of our hard work being too little to have the effect we're hoping for. There has to be a different solution for now, which is Geoengineering.

**How would it work?**

There are two main programs we will have to use, which are iron fertilization of the oceans, and stratospheric sulfate aerosols. Both of these programs are essential, and have been shown to work.

Human sulfate emissions were responsible for the pause in global warming during the 60's, because the sunlight was reflected back before it hit the Earth's surface.

We will have to do the same thing today purposefully that we did back then by accident. The CFR claims that ""one kilogram of well placed sulfur in the stratosphere would roughly offset the warming effect of several hundred thousand kilograms of carbon dioxide."" Most of this effort would be aimed at climate ""tipping points"". Examples include forests suffering from heat waves, permafrost at risk of melting, and Arctic ice. It may also be useful to have stratospheric sulfur emissions from airplanes in the Sahel, where sunlight could be reduced to the point where more plant life can grow, thus absorbing carbon from the atmosphere.

Iron fertilization is essential as well and already occurs naturally from time to time after volcanic eruptions. By encouraging carbon fixation in oceanic lifeforms, we would reduce CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere and thereby reduce the problem of ocean acidification as well. Critics argue that iron fertilization so far has not had its desired effect, because the diatoms do not sink to the ocean floor, thus removing the carbon, but instead are eaten by progressively larger organisms. I don't see this as a problem, as it merely means that the carbon remains fixed in organic lifeforms.

Minor geoengineering solutions we will use will include painting our roads, homes and automobiles white, and cloud whitening. [From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_roof)


All of this would buy us more of the time we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to zero, and reduce the size of the human population."	1	
t3_2ah1qd	CMV: earnest environmentalists should support hydroponics over organic produce.	"Hydroponics is growing plants in soil-less beds that are flooded and drained at timed intervals. It is typically done in greenhouses with natural or artificial lighting.

The drawbacks:

* it uses electricity to operate the pump and lighting.
* produce types limited. No grains or trees.

The benefits:

* less land needs to be converted. More produce per area. A recent article about a hydro grow in Japan said it produces 10'000 heads of lettuce per day on the area of half a football field.
* it is extremely water efficient. Modern facilities can operate on 1% of the amount of water conventional farms run on.
* minimal pesticides required and pesticides used do not effect local wildlife. (Contained within facility)
* very efficient fertilizer use with no runoff into groundwater (no dead zones in ocean)
* no soil erosion.
* produce can be grown out of season or in places where it would normally need to be imported, meaning less fuel used for shipping and refrigerating.
* can be done on urban environments, 'food deserts' like Detroit.

Academia is all about observing reality as it is - as indepently as possible from cultural and societal expectations we may have - and then if these facts contradict what we previously thought abandon our previous assumptions and be ready to drastically change both our mindset as well as our actions (in cases such as climate change).

This academic attitude of being willing and often even eager to ""throw away"" the way we traditionally did things and thought about stuff if there's new evidence makes it really hard for the right to really embrace science- and evidence-based policies.

So some spoilers, obviously. 

This is also a post about the Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I'm not really familiar with any of his comic counterparts. 

Quick recap summary: Thanos is a big purple alien with super strength and a funny chin. His homeworld suffered from a massive overpopulation/limited resource problem. He suggested arbitrarily killing half the population as a solution, the people rejected it, and his homeworld ended up falling to ruin due to the overpopulation/resource problem. In no small part because of this he became an intergalactic warlord who rampaged around from planet to planet systematically (but arbitrarily) culling 50% of the population of every planet he ravaged to help ""bring balance"" to the population/resource problem he became obsessed with. Realizing that perhaps there was a more efficient way to achieve this balance he sought after some magical stones that, combined, grant the user basically infinite power over everything, including the ability to do something as simple as, say, snap your fingers and eliminate half of all life in the universe instantly... which he does at the end of Infinity War. 

I posit this makes fuck all sense. 

1) The first and most glaring problem is that, if one is actually massively concerned about the problem of limited resources in the universe, so concerned, in fact, one is willing to commit mass genocide against trillions of beings and torture/sacrifice ones own children, and one possesses a bejeweled gauntlet with the power to do *literally anything,* it seems like the obvious solution is to snap your fingers and create infinite resources and habitable space for the entire universe. He could even create a universal utopia if he wanted to. Boom. Resource and overpopulation problem (and any other problem he wishes to solve if he can think of some outside of his genocidal environmentalism) solved, and nobody needs to die. But even if death is somehow required for this solution in Thanos's twisted mind: 

2) As we see from the states of the various planets in the universe, and indeed different societies in our own, not every planet/faction/culture/society is suffering from an equal resource/population problem, or *not even suffering from that problem at all* and not displaying a trajectory of ever having such a problem at all. There are societies that have already achieved a perfectly balanced and sustainable population to resource system, so Thanos would just be killing millions to solve a ""problem"" that doesnt even exist. On the other end of the extreme, given the scale of the MCU, it seems almost certain that there would be a planet that is, say, overtaxing its population:resource problem 3:1. If thanos kills off 50% of that population, they're still suffering from an overpopulation problem.

3) His ""solution"" is hardly permanent. Let's just take earth for this point. We're currently suffering from something of an unsustainable overpopulation/limited resource problem. Say a force like thanos snapped 50% of our population out of existence tomorrow. How long would it take us to just repopulate back up to current population levels all over again? Not long, and certainly in a shorter timespan than itd take for, say, our natural oil reserves to replenish or our forests to regrow. So let's say our 2019 population is reduced by half. Say it takes us 500 years to reach our prior 2019 population levels all over again... but it takes 5000 years for our resources to replenish to 2019 levels or, worse, even 50% of the population continues to use resources at a rate faster than they're able to replenish. So then basically wed be back at current population levels in 2519, but the people then would have an even greater resource to population problem than we do now. And to complicate this, every planet has it's own unique population/resource situation and will reach unsustainable levels (if they ever do) at different rates. What is Thanos's solution? Is he just going to keep snapping every time a planet reaches that level? Or just reset the whole universe every X years? Either way hes not actually ""solving"" a problem, at best hes just postponing it. He seems to think that the fact Gamora's planet is doing better now than it was when he culled it is proof his solution works, but in reality they'll just be right back where they were pre-culling (or possibly worse off) in some number of years in the future. 

4) Thanos was totally arbitrary in who he killed to solve the resource/population problem. This also makes no sense. The person who wont have any kids was just as likely to die in his purge as the person who would have ten. The person who is hyper-conscious of their effect on the environment was just as likely to be purged as someone who is a massively above average drain on our resources. If resources are scarse and overpopulation is a problem **and** killing half the population is the only solution (both **huge** ""ifs,"" as I've illustrated in earlier points), theres no reason the culling should be arbitrary or random. Some people are much greater contributors to both problems than others. The elimination process (if it has to happen at all) should be selective, not random. 

I get that this is a pretty heavy analysis for a Marvel movie, but its not impossible even in a MCU film for a villain to have a logical and well thought out motivation. From my limited understanding of his comic book counterpart hes supposed to be insane and obsessed with death and nihilism. That's a much better reason for wanting to arbitrarily kill off half of the universe. Rational concerns about overpopulation and resource scarcity are not. 

This is also meant to be an in world discussion about motivation. Replies like ""well hes supposed to be bad - if he was going to be totally benevolent in his use of the gauntlet he wouldn't be a villain and they wouldn't have a good antagonist for the film"" wont change my view on this. 

Cheers. Y'all know what to do.

t3_4bijxn	CMV: We should stop 'subsidizing' the suburbs	"This is a primarily US-centric CMV and I am not aware of how they do it abroad, so I welcome any insight.

Basically, my position is that more should be done, or at least more emphasis should be put on denser, urban-like development and simply reducing reliance on the automobile over focus on alternative fuels and clean energy (even though those are still very important). Cars that do not rely on fossil fuels still have the issue of wasted space, and a switch to those kinds of vehicles won't solve the problem of low density sprawl, which by itself, still presents environmental issues such as loss of open land and more infrastructure needed (transmission lines, water, roads, etc;) to reach far flung places away from the city. 

Now, when I say subsidize, I really am referring to the current set of policies that incentive low-density. Here are my proposals to tackle the problem:

1. Raise taxes on developers, businesses, and homeowners in such a way that forces people who want to do things that way to pay for the externalities of being in a low density suburb away from the city, along with giving tax breaks for doing the opposite.

2. Raise the gas tax to better reflect the 'true' cost of driving.

3. Get rid of downtown parking minimums and ease up on density restrictions to incentivize more development in the city itself.

t3_22vcu2	CMV: Everything is predetermined and humans don't have free will.	"
In my opinion everything is predetermined.  The movement and interaction of matter is governed by the laws of the universe (i.e. physics).  From the moment of the big bang, everything is bound to have moved exactly the way it did.  A hypothetical all knowing being would be able to predict the future with 100% accuracy.  If the future is knowable then it is predetermined and we lack free will.

The human mind does nothing more than react in a predetermined way to certain input and stimuli.  Based on your composition, your experiences etc, when you are faced with a ""decision"" an all knowing being could predict how you would react.  I think that if you ran a simulation where if someone was moved back in time, they would act exactly the same way each and every such simulation.

If external stimuli is predetermined and your reactions to that stimuli is predetermined, then your life is predetermined and you don't have free will.

Allow me to anticipate one possible objection to save time.  I do not come from a sciences background so forgive my ignorance. It does not seem to me that Heisenberg's uncertainty principle disproves determinism.  Simply because a human cannot calculate the position and momentum of a particle does not mean it is unknowable or random, it only means that we cannot know or calculate it.  

To boil it down:

Premise 1:  Interaction of matter is predetermined.
Premise 2:  Human response to external stimuli is predetermined.
Premise 3:  If everything is predetermined then humans lack free will.
Conclusion: We lack free will.

OR

Premise 1:  A being with perfect knowledge would be able to predict the future.
Premise 2:  If the future is predictable then it is predetermined.

Conclusion: we lack free will"	1	f
t3_8g0z7j	CMV: GMOs (in their undisclosed and barely regulated state) aren't advantageous to the public good.	"When I bring this up in public it's treated as paranoia, but I haven't heard a good argument directly against it yet even though I've looked, so here are my points:



-It is in the best interest of manufacturers to use products that net more money rather than those that are ""safe""

-The goal of profit at the cost of health is already shown to be in effect throughout the food supply chain (including regulators, legislators, and the Attorney General's office with the food pyramid recommendations) to the detriment of the American people in ways unrelated to GMO and going back half a century (corn subsidies leading to our country's massive corn dependence which in all recent evidence and studies, points to the morbid obesity problem here that vastly outpaces other first world countries)

-It is not in any government's best interest (local, state, fed) to enforce recalls on the scale that would be necessary if a problem with a strain of GMO crop was found--any issues with the food chain are *very* likely to cause mass hysteria, food hording, riots, shortages, etc, making it a public necessity to silently *phase out* foods that are causing problems rather than remove them immediately. Phase out of established crops takes years to decades (building up the seed, replacing existing perennial plants, etc) and may not happen at all if left to farmer's choices (tree fruits, for example, can be grafted basically eternally, and why would a farmer with a well producing crop ever opt to replace the trees?).


~~-Unlike, say, vaccines, GMOs aren't saving lives. The world has a massive amount of food waste and we would be just fine without them (albeit we'd have to get away from our dangerous reliance on monocropping), so the ""well they benefit the greater good overall even if they are eventually bad for you"" argument shouldn't apply.~~ Even where it does apply, this does not provide any rational as to why we aren't labeling and putting recall methods in place that won't destroy nations if deemed necessary.

In my mind, all of these create a situation ripe for abuse. An environment where producers were incentivized or obligated to cover up problems that are damaging to the public is *exactly* why the FDA was created to begin with. It stopped dairy distributers from watering down milk, it held sausage producers accountable for the fillers in their product, it kept sanitary standards in place for butchering.

Why aren't we holding the actual content of the food we eat to the same standards we hold it to for processing? Because profits. So why should I ""trust"" GMO food, blanket statement? If it's in your best interest to sell a basket of apples without regard to public health, knowing you had government protection if anything happened, why would I trust that none of your apples are ever poisoned? You'd sell them just the same if all of them were.

Change my view, I'm tired of being told I'm paranoid for seeing it as the next leaded gas."	1	f
t3_56dd4n	CMV: Having a large percentage of the population become Vegetarian will result in more waste.	"First, some definitions:

* Vegetarian: Somebody who doesn't eat animal meat.  Eggs/Milk/Honey/Gelatin are OK.  Leather products are OK. Pets are OK.
* Vegan: Somebody who doesn't consume animal products.  Eggs/Milk/Honey/Gelatin are not OK. Leather not OK. Pets not OK.

Now some stats (I'll stick to just the US):

* 3.2% of the population consider themselves vegetarian
* 0.5% consider themselves vegan.
[Source](http://www.vegetariantimes.com/article/vegetarianism-in-america)


So in my mind, a vegetarian society is one where everybody (or most people) still consumes animal products, they just don't eat the meat once it finally dies.  

In my mind this is unsustainable because it's egregiously wasteful.  Nobody in their right mind will let 1500 lbs of beef just rot after the cow dies. Sure, some will be used in cat/dog food and leather production.  But if milk/egg demand stays where it is now, we'll still have tons of wasted, perfectly edible meat leftover.

This isn't true in a vegan society, as over time there will be fewer and fewer cows and chickens.  This, I submit, is the most efficient plan but least tasty (in my opinion).

It also isn't true in our current omnivore society because the 3.2% that don't use that *final bit* will be covered by the rest of the population.  However, I think there exists a number, x%, where there simply won't be enough meat eaters to eat all the leftovers.  Something like 75% vegetarian, 5% vegan, 20% meat eater.  This will result in a lot of wasted meat.

So, to sum up, encouraging more people to become vegetarian is good up until a certain percentage point.  After we reach that point, it would be better to encourage them to become vegan/omnivore instead.  A society with a large percentage of omnivorous or a large percentage of vegans is not wasteful.  A society with a large number of vegetarians is wasteful.

t3_7ldqex	CMV: Genetically-modified foods are a scientific revolution that will change the world for better. They pose no harm to human health or the environment.	"The use of genetically-modified organisms (GMOs) will reduce global hunger and make it easier to consume affordable, nutritious foods. Climate change is depleting the amount of arable land, so producers need an economical way to feed the world's growing population. The only solution is genetically modified crops. More [here](http://www.newsweek.com/2015/05/29/gmo-scientists-could-save-world-hunger-if-we-let-them-334119.html).

According to a 2014 [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25184846) by UC Davis: ""These field data sets, representing over 100 billion animals following the introduction of GE crops, did not reveal unfavorable or perturbed trends in livestock health and productivity. No study has revealed any differences in the nutritional profile of animal products derived from GE-fed animals."" Cornell's [Alliance for Science](https://allianceforscience.cornell.edu/) has reached the same conclusion, saying that GMOs are a perfectly healthy solution for food insecurity. 

The anti-GMO lobby is largely guided by emotional appeal, rather than any type of scientific understanding. The anti-GMO crowd has 0 scientific evidence to hang their hat on. There exist no examples of unbiased, peer-reviewed studies that show GMOs are harmful to humans, animals, or the environment. 

I welcome the use of GMOs on store shelves around the world. I gladly buy these products for my own personal consumption and will continue to do so until any scientific evidence proves the risks outweigh the benefits. Is there any reason to doubt the scientific consensus here? What, if any, reasons are there to to believe GMO consumption is bad?  

Note: This CMV is not about how some companies have a monopoly over GMO patents/seeds (i.e. Monsanto). We all hate Monsanto and I already agree with you on that, so there's no reason to debate how evil Monsanto is.  


On another note, it seems there are 2 big things going on here: (1) any potential environmental problems posed by GMOs really look like problems with modern agricultural techniques - not problems that are solely blamed on GMOs. Problems like decreased biodiversity and superbugs/superweeds are issues that we already face with regular agricultural techniques. GMOs *might* exacerbate the problem, but they aren't the sole cause. In fact, it still seems GMOs could be engineered to ameliorate these problems. (2) There is lots of talk about how GMO crops contribute to increased allergenicity and also the decline of butterfly/honeybee populations. So far, I haven't seen any convincing evidence that backs either of those claims. It's healthy to be skeptical about that possibility, but so far it doesn't seem like there's any scientific evidence to back those claims. 

As a whole, my view hasn't changed much. Many of the problems associated with GMOs are based on speculation of what could happen in theory, rather than what we're actually seeing in practice.

t3_2hh4ou	CMV: Whether or not Leo DiCaprio or Al Gore uses private jets or yachts has absolutely nothing to do with climate change or their credibility in speaking out.	"I feel like this is an incredibly common, cynical sentiment you read all over the Internet: ""pfft I bet DiCaprio took a private jet and a yacht to get to the speech. Typical hollywood hypocrite. Climate Change is a farce."" and rarely do I see anyone stick up for the obvious truth and put that argument to bed. 

Whether or not DiCaprio uses a jet has absolutely no bearing on whether or not Climate Change is a real problem. It has absolutely no bearing on whether or not he can speak on it. What, is he supposed to travel by hot air balloon? There is no hypocrisy, because no one is advocating the ban of private jets. No one is advocating that everyone must take a vow of poverty before they can be considered a credible advocate. The message is that POLICY needs to change. Big scale economic and global policy is needed, because the problem is trillions of times bigger than one guy and his yacht. I have never heard these guys advocate the ban of private jets. I've never heard them advocate the ban of yachts. I've never heard them say that every individual needs to take a vow of poverty. So, they are not hypocrites. Thus, attacking them personally for not being perfectly flawless examples of carbon-free lifestyles is clearly just attacking the messenger, setting up an unreasonable strawman, and trying to shut down the debate. It adds nothing constructive, does not have anything to do with the science itself or the validity of the message itself, it's a pure red herring.

t3_fgvmvv	CMV: We can't save the environment with market-based solutions (only)	"Hi guys, so my point is:

We see a lot of ""market-based"" instruments when it comes to topics as fighting climate change, protecting the oceans, saving the Amazon rainforest etc. And I just don't think those instruments won't accomplish enough to solve environmental problems.

When I talk about ""market-based"" solutions I talk about legislation that manages incentives for corporations and citizens - in stark contrast to ""hard legislation"", such as outlawing specific actions. A market-based solution would be to allow a certain cap on fossil fuels to use, while ""regulation"" in my understanding as a counterpart to it would ban the use of fossil fuels (maybe under certain conditions). Let me explain it with an example.

The most commonly known ""market-based"" approach to save the environment might be the trade of CO2 certificates. While I agree that they have some effect, I don't think that this instrument does enough to spare us real regulation when it comes to aviation or individual transport by non-electric cars. While in theory, the current system incentivizes not to harm the environment, it *actually* incentivizes corporations to continue to do harm to the environment (as in: to us all), but in a way that is ""market-approved"". As long as someone can pay for the harm caused, corporations don't have to worry about their business models. It's just a small fee they pay, it's indulgence trading.

Don't get me wrong: I'm not saying that we should not use market-based instruments at all. While I don't like the idea that you can just buy your way out of the mess you cause. I just think that market-based approaches *alone* don't give good incentives and are not enough to solve the problems we face today. I think what's needed is international regulation on a near-global level. While I agree that this is hard to accomplish, I think market-based solutions are just the easy way out for some governments that don't really acknowledge the problem. And many large scale regulations that were negotiated in the last century (think UNCLOS, which manages the protection of the Oceans) show that it can be done.

I think I can prove my point here, but as so many people seem to be gasping in awe when it comes to market-based instruments I thought I'd like to hear the arguments of the other side.

And btw. this is my first CMV so I hope I did everything right. :D

t3_3n206m	"CMV: The argument, ""There is a large consensus in the scientific community,"" is a valid point to bring up in an argument."	"Now, I'm not saying that scientists can't be wrong nor am I saying that a majority of scientists can't be wrong. However, I am often told that ""there is a consensus"" is not an argument and should not be brought up in a debate. But the fact that there is a consensus, in my opinion, should carry weight. Scientists are men and women whose job is to hypothesize and test those hypothesis and determine if their hypothesis was tested to be right or wrong; their secondary, but just as important, job is to call and point out the bullshit that their peers may say, to find the mistake in the experiments if there are any. So saying ""there is a consensus"" isn't just saying that some smart people believe something; it's saying that there is a wealth of evidence to so support an idea that the most skeptical people in the world have come together and said: ""all the evidence we have is pointing to this being right."" 

I am not saying that we shouldn't look into the things that scientists say nor should we trust everything they say but the very fact that there is a consensus should hold a lot more weight than it does today. 


So I've seen a few counterarguments that keep coming up so I'll address them here. 

1. You cannot use the fact that ""there is a large consensus"" to prove something.

Well...yeah. I know. I never said that the fact that there is a large consensus should be the end all be all, simply that it shouldn't be seen as worthless. I don't understand why the fact that there is a large consensus is just shrugged off with a  ""whatever""

2. Science can be wrong. 

Again, I did admit that the consensus can be wrong. But to logically follow this argument is to say that you cannot trust science at all, that you should interpret everything yourself. The point of specialization is that if you have not specialized in something, say a field in science, it should not be your job to know about that field. Why should I, a non-scientist, be able to talk about astronomy as well as say Neil deGrasse Tyson? 

3. By saying that there is a consensus, I'm using an asshole argument

I would argue instead that by saying that there is a consensus, I am merely asking you what makes you doubt the consensus? If you have had a different experience, that sucks. And I admit that there are places in which saying that there is a consensus adds nothing to the conversation/argument but why is it dismissed all the time?

4. A consensus means nothing

Saying that a consensus is nothing is like saying ""the theory of evolution by natural selection isn't true because it's only a theory."" But the fact that this is a theory implies that there is so much evidence toward this hypothesis that the scientific community has agreed that there is a low likelihood that new evidence will come to light to disprove this hypothesis. A consensus is similar in that there is evidence implied in the word, that for the consensus to have existed that there is evidence for it! 

5. You're appealing to an authority

Yes...I am because they know more than me and know more than the average laymen. When a plumber tells me that I need to fix my plumbing, I'll probably trust him. If I feel I need a second opinion, I won't go to a doctor, I'll go to another plumber. I am trusting in the people who know about the subject matter to tell me about it. 

6. A scientist studying A won't know about B

Of course, that's why I'm trusting the people studying B when I say that there is a consensus on B. I'm talking about the relevant academics.

7. Some comparison to religion

The difference between religion and science has always been that the former doesn't look for proof. And that's okay, that's what a religion is. It's a moral guidance and it's unlikely that science will ever come up with a ""we have proved what is right and wrong.""

t3_4hdubt	CMV: The existence of evil is not compatible with the existence of God.	"
Let's start out by defining what I mean--by ""God,"" I mean a being that has at least these three traits:  omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence.  You can tell me whether you think ""omnipotence"" includes being able to do logically impossible things, or if it only means being able to do all logically possible things.  By omnibenevolence I mean always preferring what is morally good, or always choosing the morally best option out of all alternatives available.

By ""evil"" I mean anything that makes the world worse than perfect, or if you think there's no such thing as a ""perfect world,"" than anything that makes a world worse than the best possible world.  So I don't just mean animal cruelty is evil and the Holocaust was evil, I also mean stubbing your toe is evil.

If a perfectly good, all-knowing, all-powerful being existed, then it would know what the best possible world would be like, would want to create the best possible world, and would be able to create the best possible world.  So if God existed, the actual world would not contain any evil, since God would have chosen to create the best possible world, which contains no evil, instead.  

Further, I would argue that in our world we do find evil, both evil caused by agents, and natural evil, which was not caused by anything that could even be argued to have agency (except, of course, God).  The nature of this evil is both abundant and clearly superfluous--it doesn't seem necessary that small children suffer agonizing deaths on a regular basis, for example.  So if you really want to change my view, show me how the type and amount of evil we see in the actual world is consistent with the existence of god.

Note that I'm not trying to be convinced that any specific god does exist, or that god exists at all, but only that the existence of God would be compatible with the existence of evil (that we see in our world).  It would be too much to ask of you that you also convinced me a god existed.  So just limit your attempt to CMV to why evil could exist in a world with an omnibenevolent, omniscient, omnipotent being.

Here are some good articles to read if you want to do some research before attempting to CMV:

t3_4j2g2d	CMV:I think much of the republican party is built on lies	"I think the republican party is largely built on lies, and not in a comperable way that the demcorats are.[for instance](http://climate.nasa.gov/) Climate change is a massive threat, arguably [the greatest one we face](http://foreignpolicy.com/2015/02/03/top-twenty-five-schools-international-relations/) , but [most](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2015/01/08/3608427/climate-denier-caucus-114th-congress/) deny its existence.  And the ones that don't, don't support much in the way of doing anything about it. We literally have republicans [throwing snowballs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3E0a_60PMR8) on the floor of congress to 'disprove' the science, I don't think this is a difference of opinion, but rather a deliberate misinformation campaign in an attempt to trick voters.

I think this is because [91% of the time the better funded candidate wins](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/04/04/think-money-doesnt-matter-in-elections-this-chart-says-youre-wrong/), and republicans [are bankrolled by the fossil fuel industry](https://www.opensecrets.org/industries/indus.php?ind=e01)

Their stance on taxes, which based on their rhetoric is meant to cut taxes on the working class and middle class or [all americans](http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/video/video.pd2upload.com/video.yahoofinance.com@b6b5ed88-77fb-3917-bc08-26e71235f31b_FULL.jpg), is mainly for [the rich](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2013/01/02/the-legacy-of-the-bush-tax-cuts-in-four-charts/)  Some say, this is good for the economy, and helps in the way of helping the 'job creators', so much so that it's revenue neutral, but this is [not a popular theory in economics](http://www.igmchicago.org/igm-economic-experts-panel/poll-results?SurveyID=SV_2irlrss5UC27YXi)  Even Bushes treaury secretary warned him against his tax cuts, but feels he was swayed by the [""the corporate crowd,""](http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,574809,00.html)  Trump wants more tax cuts for the [rich](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/publications/analysis-donald-trumps-tax-plan), while acting like he doesn't.

t3_9u48lv	CMV: Fahrenheit is the superior unit of measurement when discussing air temperature	"Fahrenheit is the superior unit of measurement when referring to ambient temperatures. Zero is about as cold as human environments get, and 100 is about as hot as they get.

Humans are very used to and comfortable with 0-100 scales.

Celsius is the superior unit of measurement when referring to scientific temperatures. Water freezes at zero and boils at 100.

A scale of 1-100 also allows for more precision. You have almost three times the number of discrete intervals as Celsius, which only goes up to about 38 degrees when discussing air temperature."	1	f
t3_2u1s4k	CMV: Future government structures need to include scientists who are not voted in by the general populace	"I am putting this out there, as I have been mentally debating this for the last few months and want to see if my views hold water. Also note that many of my arguments specifically address the USA's system of government and its flaws, but many of the same arguments transfer over to other governments.


* I am not advocating for a complete elimination of elected politicians, as I believe they most certainly have their place in any well-run government. Simply a rebalancing of the current system, as I believe it is currently unbalanced.
* Scientists by definition are ""one engaging in a systematic activity to acquire knowledge"" (from wikipedia). This does not delineate one type over the other, so be careful with applying your own definition of the word scientist here.
* I do not have a perfect answer of how to pick said scientists. One idea would be to have scientists self-select from within their ranks. (this does bring up the point of how any system with the ability to campaign for power can become corrupted)

**Representatives in general elections are chosen based on likability, similarity to voters, and marketing.**

People often chose candidates based on the quality of marketing (often influenced by the amount of money spent) that each campaign utilizes. In addition, with the recent additions of visual media - optimism, likability, personality, etc plays more of a role than suitability or intelligence. Thus, our current system selects candidates that may not be able to make the best decisions for the future of the nation. 

**Decision making in government is currently, heavily influenced by special interests and the financial elite.

I believe that the representatives in congress have lost the long-term focus of their positions in order to achieve short-term results, particularly re-election and satisfying their ""constituents"" ([particularly the elites and special interests](http://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/mgilens/files/gilens_and_page_2014_-testing_theories_of_american_politics.doc.pdf)). Lastly, their position does not require strong science backgrounds, with many of them coming from either a law or political science background.

**The recent industrial revolution has given us the ability to do permanent, global damage in relatively short amounts of time**

Simply stated, our recent advances in technology have allowed us more and more control over our environment, often at the expense of the impact on the world at large. These impacts include including species extinctions, ecology changes, and much more. 300-400 years ago, these impacts were small on a global scale. However, as we advanced faster and faster, we became a globally interconnected society reliant on fossil fuels, petrochemicals, electromagnetic radiation, and genetically modified food sources. Note that these are doomsday conspiracy claims, as each one has contributed to where we are today in a positive way, however, their overall impact on the environment is often not viewed in its entirety These impacts have, and will continue to, cause some huge and likely unexpected impacts on the world at large.

**Scientists usually have a more balanced and reasoned approach to making changes**

As scientists have spent years becoming better scientists instead of better politicians, they have developed some pretty valuable skills, including finding quality knowledge sources, questioning data, finding holes, identifying key features, etc. As such, they are often more knowledgeable, have a better approach to problems, and have a more long-term view of the future.

**With the above thoughts in mind, my view is that scientists would be an extremely valuable addition to any governmental structure, giving it the ability to make long-term decisions with better clarity than is possible today.** 

As for the US, as much as I would love to pull out one house of Congress and replace it with a group of scientists, I don't think this is reasonable at this stage. If we started over, then maybe, but not 225+ years down the line. Instead, we need to inject this influence in other ways, possibly adding a new branch of government or a third house of Congress with a new ability to influence laws in a novel way. (The exact details here are up for debate, including how to select the best people for these position, but I am trying to reason about the big picture)

**TL;DR If we really want to make long term changes that will result in a sustainable approach to the future, we need to include scientists and data driven decision making at a much higher level of government. Scientists as advisors isn't enough.**

t3_bsvi77	CMV: We should all switch from beef to beans in our diet.	"As a disclaimer, I am a vegetarian who is slowly transitioning to veganism. One of the reasons I switched to vegetarianism was the devastation animal agriculture brings on the environment.

My view is that consuming beef is extremely harmful to the environment, and converting to a diet that replaces beef with beans is significantly better for the environment and health overall.

Globally, and especially in the United States, beef consumption is on the rise. What the majority of people I have talked to do not realize is that consuming beef contributes to deforestation, water pollution, significant water consumption, decreased biodiversity, and dangerous greenhouse gas emissions. Beef is not a sustainable form of protein. Beans are sustainable and significantly cheaper!

Now I am not calling for everyone to go vegan or to 100% stop eating all meat, that is just unrealistic. But, just eliminating one meat source from your diet has such positive benefits I don't see the downside other than taste.

I would be interested to see evidence that my above claims are not true, or that beef does not have a negative impact on the environment, or that beef is sustainable!

t3_i2xgen	"CMV: We shouldn’t worry about how much paper we use, and whether we recycle it. It’s not a problem to “kill a tree” to use paper"	"I think that of all the things we should be focusing on as zero waste, saving and reusing cardboard and paper should be the lowest priority. I hardly count it as waste. Paper making is a very sustainable process, does very little pollution for the output, and every paper company replants trees they cut down.

And despite what you may have been taught in primary school (as I was) cutting down a tree doesn’t just release all the carbon back into the atmosphere... it just prevents it from collecting new carbon. But new trees can collect more carbon per year anyway, so it’s better to cut them down and plant new trees for more carbon.
I’d rather throw away or recycle paper, knowing that it will dissolve, and is a renewable resource, than sweat about it from a zero/low waste perspective."	1	
t3_23dfdz	"CMV: Africa needs more agricultural technology, not less."	"With the increased popularity of organic and natural foods in Western, developed countries, there has been a similar push in Africa to promote organic and resist modern agricultural technology. This is a dangerous type of exporting first world values to lesser developed countries that is only going to perpetuate poverty, malnutrition, and reliance on foreign aid.

Africa needs access to high-yield hybrid varieties, and modern fertilizer and pesticides. African governments, as well as foreign aid donors, need to start investing in agricultural technology as a way of supporting the small rural farmer and stop cycles of poverty. 

Western NGOs need to stop their crusade against genetically modified crops, a costly effort which has caused numerous African governments to put in place harsh regulation and restrictions on the use of GMOs. Efforts of Greenpeace and the like are actively hurting small farmers and children, with the only benefit being the ability to pander for 1st world donations and membership fees.

t3_4jeezm	CMV : Temperature readings from NASA have intentionally been altered to create the illusion of warming temperatures.	"Between the years 2010 and 2012 the data measured since 1881 were altered so that they showed a significant warming, especially after 1950. […] A comparison of the data from 2010 with the data of 2012 shows that NASA-GISS had altered its own datasets so that especially after WWII a clear warming appears – although it never existed.”  

And even if it is unintentional 

example, a new building constructed next to a monitoring station could cast a shadow over a station, or change wind patterns, in such ways that could affect the readings. Also, the timing of temperature measurements has varied over time. And in the 1980s, most U.S. stations switched from liquid-in-glass to electronic resistance thermometers, which could both cool maximum temperature readings and warm minimum readings.

Wouldn't that mean our temperature readings are inconsistent and not entirely trustworthy? "	1	
t3_3us75y	CMV: We care too much about species going extinct	"I think that animals going extinct for any reason, related to human intervention or otherwise, is the natural course of life on Earth. Darwin's Theory of Evolution is the most widely-accepted scientific theory for how life got to the stage it is at now, and part of that theory is that life that does not adapt to changes in the environment or to risks posed by other life dies. Therefore, it makes sense that any animal going extinct for any reason whatsoever is just a part of evolution, because that species' extinction is proof that it was unable to adapt to whatever caused its demise.

In addition, human intervention to try and *stop* the extinction of animals is a pointless waste of time and resources. If the animals need our help, then they are obviously not ""worthy"" of continued existence.

In short, the extinction of species that are unable to adapt is natural, and we should not waste resources on trying to prevent it.

t3_d3caiu	CMV: The FAA should end the ban on hydrogen as a lifting gas for blimps.	"Blimps carry enormous potential to change the way that we transport goods around the world. They can travel around the world with very little power using the jet stream. With a small number of solar powered fans to help them maneuver, they could travel essentially indefinitely. Given the development of automated drones, it seems that they could also fly without any people on board at risk from any fire. In a world where we are concerned about the externalities of fossil fuel use, it seems clear that we should not inhibit low energy use ways of transporting goods and or people.

Hydrogen is a cheaper and lighter lifting gas than Helium and is completely renewable. Helium on the other hand frequently faces shortages.

Hydrogen blimps were banned in response to several explosions during the infancy of the technology including the Hindenburg explosion. Technology has rapidly advanced since the 1930's and passenger aircraft have been flying for many decades. Insurance markets are also much more developed. We could build much safer blimps today than when hydrogen was banned as a lifting gas.

Why shouldn't we end the ban on hydrogen use as a lifting gas in Blimps?

t3_bbn5tv	CMV: It is likely Republicans will continue to control the US Government Indefinitely	"Back in 2012, after the election, I remarked to a friend that 2016 would be the most important election of my lifetime because the party in power would be in a position to set up an indefinite control of the government come 2020. **My view is that the Republican party currently controls the US Government and will continue to control the US Government for the indefinite future.** How long that future will be is hard to predict. Maybe eight years, maybe twenty, maybe more. There may be a brief gap period. But the future will be Republican.


I base this position on the following:


**Donald Trump will win 2020 and maintain control of at least one half of Congress, likely both.**

As the incumbent Trump enjoys the incumbent advantage. He has a reliable base that will not break from him and consistently votes. He has at best done nothing to protect our voting systems and at worst sought to weaken protections. His opponents are currently fairly divided (although we are still very far out) but none seem likely to inspire both the Left to vote and Independents to vote with them. And even if Trump is unpopular it does not matter because the unpopularity is geographically restricted compared to his rural support. The electoral college is once again likely to seal a win even if he does not win the popular vote.


**Republicans will control the 2020 census.**

Due to the above, if Trump is re-elected Republicans will control the 2020 census and redistricting. They will, as they have in the past, gerrymander the country in their favor as much as possible. Alternatively, if the census is sabotaged in some way, the current districts, favoring Republicans, will continue to be used. Thus, for the next decade, elections will continue to favor Republicans based on districts. And the Supreme Court is not likely to strike down gerrymandering any time soon.


**The Urban-Rural Divide favors Republicans.**

Republicans enjoy rural support while Democrats enjoy more urban support. The problem is that while urban support has a higher population, rural support is geographically wider. The Senate is designed as an institution to favor smaller population states, and as much as I dislike the Republican control of it it is nonetheless doing just that. The House, however, is not able to counterbalance the Senate because it is capped. The House is meant to represent population and favor more populous states, but with a cap in place is no longer able to effectively do so. More rural states are favored in both parts of Congress. Further, the House can be gerrymandered where the Senate cannot. A greater population favoring Democrats in smaller urban areas is simple to manipulate to create as many rural--and thus Republican--districts and representatives as possible with as few urban districts and Democrats as possible.


The joint-effect of the census and the urban-rural divide cannot be understated, as it ensures that, even if Democrats win the presidency and a unified Congress (somehow) it is likely to be quickly re-lost come the next election, where the presidential party is already predisposed to endure losses.


**The Courts.**

If the Republicans hold power in 2020 it is unlikely that all the aging liberal justices will survive until the next election, granting Republicans the ability to further solidify the Supreme Court as conservative. More subtly, an enormous portion of the lower federal court judges are conservative to far-right, a number increasing as judges are passed through the Senate. The combined power of the conservative justice system will be to neuter any left-wing legislation that a Democratic government may pass, removing as many Democratic policy victories and further portraying Democrats as inept. Notably this is likely to occur even if Democrats win in 2020, as the judiciary is already stacked against them.


There is, of course, the possibility Democrats will win the presidency and at least one half of Congress. Then all bets are off. But I am doubtful.


Disproving the above points would go a long way towards changing my view, although changing just one or so would likely be insufficient as they are pretty interconnected.


*This is not a debate on what the actual policy effects of an indefinite Republican government will be, although I fear they will be catastrophic. And while I have no doubt Trump, should he win in 2020, will do everything he can to further consolidate power (either for himself personally or for Republicans) that is also outside the scope of this CMV. And please don't talk about winning and controlling state governments in a federal system, I am referring to the federal government in this CMV. Adding state governments would make this too vast.*"	1	f
t3_f4abyk	"CMV: Warren and Sanders are not radicals, they are moderate social democrats by European standards"	"This view is based on some doing some basic research on both Sander's and Warren's websites. They both have proposed systemic changes that will tackle economic inequality. Progressive taxation, a wealth tax, a higher minimum wage, etc. It's mostly about reversing the past few decades that reduced taxes on the wealthy and allowing wages to stagnate. I don't see anything radical there. Anything too radical or against the constitution would be challenged in the courts which are currently conservative. So I think all this worry about Sanders and Warren is not based on anything they've put forward. It's more of a knee-jerk reaction to change. Change that a lot of people in the working class would like to see and benefit the most from."	1	f
t3_377t3z	CMV: I think FIFA should keep the 2022 World Cup in Qatar	"I don't see that much wrong with it. It is promoting tourism to the middle east and raises awareness for the developing country of Qatar, much like South Africa did. As well, it gives the Qatar National Team a chance to compete in the World Cup. I feel economically it is beneficial for both Fifa and Qatar. 2022 is a long way from now, and Qatar has promised that it would be able to fix the problem with heat using a stadium wide cooling system. 

I'm also excited to see all the modern technology that will be implemented into this World Cup. Also, I feel it would be a waste of money and time if the World Cup was moved somewhere else. Construction has already started and countries have already moved on to preparing bids for another World Cup. A sudden change of location could be disastrous for certain countries. 

Finally, in the end, we go to and watch the World Cup because football is football. There should be more time spent focusing on the emergence of stars in the World Cup, how teams can adapt to weather, how today's young stars will play in their prime. 

With all this said, change my view!"	1	
t3_o7d8z5	CMV: The US will be under some form of government that won’t described as a “democracy “ within the next 20 years.	"The current state of politics has given rise to both far right and far left voices in the two parties. What was once referred to as radical ideas on both sides is becoming more mainstream thinking. Movements within the parties are gaining media names and exposure. I don’t believe the US government will collapse. I believe it will shift slowly on one direction over time. I think very little will happen until after Biden leaves office whether or not he is in one or two terms. 

If you want to call it threats to democracy then you can describe it right now as a large number of threats from both the left and right. Eventually someone is going to win. I believe whoever wins out will make enough changes that the government will move just enough to no longer be a democracy. 

I’m also not saying this is some conspiracy. My thought is this will just be a slow progression of where the government moves as power shifts.

This was never meant to turn into any debate over what the changes would be. Left or right, doesn't matter. I'm just saying it will change.  By threats I did not mean violent ones only. Also the change may be subtle. I'm not talking about revolution. It's possible we elect very socialist presidents who at our own asking take us on a path towards less democracy. I'm also not stating that this change has to be negative. Maybe we want the changes or a controlling party's platform is the changes. 
All change in government does not need to be revolution or violent overthrown. Not all government change needs to be negative.

For this case assume I'm only talking change. The change is away from democracy to something else. Positive change, or negative does not matter. 

Some have made me think this timeline is a bit short, which I may agree withbut I'll stand by the 20 yr timeline for now."	1	
t3_2428k1	CMV: Baby Boomers (as a collective - not entirely or individually) are the problem with progress	"I have had this conversation about the effectiveness of generations for a while now. I've talked about it with different demographics of age and race and ultimately I come back to the same conclusion. The baby boomer generation has generated the bulk majority of major issues that we currently face and when they have retired the world will be a better place. I'm going to break this down into the typical claims that people make for and against them to make this easier, because when you talk to a boomer, they claim all kinds of outlandish things and likewise I have seen nonsensical rants from other millennials with absolutely no basis. Thus, here we go.

**CLAIMS ABOUT SYSTEMS THAT BOOMERS HAVE BROKEN**

* 1. *Climate Change Induced By Humans*

http://judithcurry.com/2014/02/27/nasrs-report-on-climate-change-evidence-and-causes/

Arguably the beginning to excessive use of chemicals that damage our environment was begun by the Boomer generation. Their use of such materials has eroded the use of the more safe alternatives and created dependency. As millennials, we are tasked with making sacrifices that they never made in order to help reverse the actions taken. 

* 2. *Savings and Loans*

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Savings_and_loan_crisis#Major_causes_and_lessons_not_learned

**DISCLAIMER: I know this is wiki, but there are about 40 sources at the bottom of the page**

Ultimately the major underlying factor among all of the causes of this crisis is a boomer at the head of the banking that governs savings and loans. Giving predatory loans to people who could never afford them so that they could get a bonus was regular. All of the causes for the problems with the S&L industry were done by boomers in charge and supported by boomers in the senate.

* 3. *MASSIVE inflation resulting in stunted subsequent growth*

http://inflationdata.com/Inflation/Inflation_Rate/HistoricalInflation.aspx

Inflation as boomers graduated high school was around 1.5-2%. Ten years later they were hovering 11-12% inflation while having an increased ability to earn money and having the largest voting block of all time. Not only were they beginning to take power at this time, but they were enjoying the false fruits of epic inflation of gross proportions that led to recession in the 80's. This is actually a huge indicator of massive unemployment that began then and a huge trend in wild spending of money without concern for the future - as we can currently see.

* 4. *Sending Jobs Overseas*

http://www.factcheck.org/2012/10/talking-tax-breaks-for-offshoring/

Several tax laws (Not NAFTA or other trade agreements - although the certainly didn't help) have caused problems with retaining domestic positions. Until these laws were enacted by Clinton (the first boomer president) and by a primarily boomer senate, the concept of trickle down was actually working pretty well. The problem with trickle down economics is greed, and these tax cuts enabled the wealthy to become wealthier without providing positions for the middle and lower class, leading me to my next point.

* 5. *Wealth Inequality*

http://www.cbpp.org/images/cms/11-28-11pov-f1.png

http://www.cbpp.org/cms/?fa=view&id=3629

As a result of the points made in #4, you see in this graph a disparity that has origins in the 70's/80's, as boomers were taking the helm at corporate america. 

* 6. *Inflating College Costs*

http://financemymoney.com/student-loan-market-college-loans-for-profit-education-pell-grants-debt-educational-outcomes-bubble-in-higher-education/

https://www.google.com/search?q=inflating+college+costs+over+time&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=IxRcU-zeM6XM2gXTroC4DQ&ved=0CAYQ_AUoAQ&biw=1280&bih=899#facrc=_&imgdii=_&imgrc=QI8vHg0rMltR4M%253A%3BrRVG6WqDJ3-nAM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fupload.wikimedia.org%252Fwikipedia%252Fcommons%252F2%252F2e%252FCollegeTuitionsUsCanada1940to2000.png%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Fen.wikipedia.org%252Fwiki%252FCollege_tuition_in_the_United_States%3B664%3B558

Tuition fees drastically have expanded due to several problems in funding from the federal government that was enacted by Boomers. The loan system for banks is now hopelessly tied to these loans. It would actually be less expensive to forgive all college debt than it would be to bail out all of the banks again. Banks should not be too big to fail. 

* 7. *Outrageous Oil Prices*

So in the 1970's there was the Iran/Iraq war, which you could argue either way whether we could have helped or not as it's a non-domestic issue. Sure the boomers were taking the helm during that era and held the largest voting block, but I think that it might be fair to write that one off to foreign soil and/or the Silent Generation. Probably more the former than the latter. The second spike, however, is directly in time with us declaring war on an unspecified target (Terrorism?) and pursuing an agenda of military action in the middle east. Coincidentally this was approved in mass by the boomers in politics that were voted for by boomers in majority (roughly 50% of boomers vote as opposed to about 20-30% of other age groups). The more disturbing price is the ""real"" price and not the nominal one, which is at unparalleled heights in all of history - even since the massive spikes in the 1800's.

* 8. *Social Security Problems*

http://www.nasi.org/learn/socialsecurity/boomers

http://www.cato.org/publications/congressional-testimony/social-security-baby-boomers

Boomers have statistically paid less into social security and will cash out more from it than any other demographic in history. If it doesn't bankrupt the system, the burden of keeping the system alive will not only shift to the millennials but to the generations after them who will be paying higher tax rates with lower volumes of jobs and less opportunities. By 2032 the boomers will all be able to claim SSI and the system will begin to unravel or taxes will be ravaging everyone besides them. 

* 9. *The Housing Bubble*

http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.367.6248&rep=rep1&type=pdf

Baby boomers routinely were valuing all of the homes that they had as higher and higher among one another while no actual changes were taking place to the home. A house I bought two years ago, despite having more problems that would exceed the added value to the home, increased in value out of simple principle for some reason. The thought to a lot of boomers was that the properties gained value, and they inherited this from the Silent Generation. That *USED* to be true when the bulk of properties were large sprawls of land and had very large homes. The reason those homes gained value is because many of them were gone when we started building more houses and started making them smaller. The problem is that boomers ignored this and just kept tacking on value to homes without regard for other trends and then the bubble burst because of other issues that they caused specifically in the Savings & Loans industry. 

* 10. *One Of The Least Effective Congress' in History*

http://www.mediaite.com/online/2013-congress-one-of-the-least-productive-in-history/

http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/319997-pew-113th-congress-not-the-least-productive-yet-

Despite the boomers having a majority of 65 Senators (to 28 Silent Generation and 9 Xers) in the senate, having 33 states worth of governors, and a total of 276 voting members in the house of representatives (64.137931%). With all of this done and the members collecting their salaries they are among the least productive of all time and are doing the absolute least to impact change because they are so polarized in their factions and they all want to ""fight the power"" rather than realize that THEY ARE the power and unity is what they need rather than fighting.

* 11. *MASSIVE Government Debt*

http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2013/06/29/how-the-baby-boomers-destroyed-americas-future.aspx


So debt isn't inherently evil if you are producing product to compensate or if you have investments that can counteract the debt by producing dividends. Unfortunately, the programs that the boomers have enacted for entitlement (specifically for the elderly and retired - convenient now that they are retiring) with no actual return far exceed the actual investment and cause a problem that can only be overcome with more product or more investment that must be sacrificed by the generations following them. 

**CLAIMS ABOUT SUPPOSED VICTORIES OF THE BOOMERS**

* 1. *Civil Rights*

http://lmgtfy.com/?q=when+was+the+civil+rights+act+passed

The Civil Rights act was passed in 1964 - which was right when the oldest boomers were graduating high school. They likely remember it, but hardly did they have any impact on the legislation for it. Only one year worth of them were able to vote. Hardly an impact on Civil Rights.

* 2. *Musical Revolution*

This is actually decidedly true. The Boomers decidedly changed the face of music. Peter Frampton, Journey, Michael Jackson, Queen (Freddie Mercury), and a host of others. Denying the boomers the musical revolution is asinine. They basically invented good music. 

* 3. Vietnam

http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/vietnam/timeline.htm

http://www.history.com/topics/vietnam-war/tet-offensive

While you can make an argument that protests were making change in America, we were profiting hand over fist from the war. The problem is that there was a balance between the cost of life and the profit that we were gaining. The deaths and people sent over to vietnam were increasing, but the profits held steady, which is a negative trend. The war seemed to be leaning that it would be coming to an end. The Tet Offensive by the Vietnamese drastically changed that outlook and made it appear as it truly would be - a stalemate - and decidedly marked the point where we changed our stance. The Vietnamese essentially ended our involvement in the war with the Tet Offensive. 

http://listverse.com/2013/05/02/10-nefarious-conspiracies-proven-true/

Not to mention that Operation Northwoods decidedly left the boomer generation in the dark about what was really happening because they also didn't have the internet or access to information besides the news. (Let's not even get into the other proven true conspiracies about their time in power - like the heart attack gun)

It should be noted though that they did need to endure the draft, which was horrendous by any standards and they have my sympathies on that end especially given that the war was essentially for profit.

* 4. *Women's Rights*

http://www.infoplease.com/spot/womenstimeline2.html

Theoretically this is ambiguous. A lot of monumental legislation like the CRA and other things were passed before they were even in the opportunity to vote for such legislation. There was also a massive movement of women's rights that were happening previous to their time pushing it. On the other side of that coin, they DID push that agenda for women dramatically and caused a lot more things to happen in the public spotlight than had previously. This one I would call a draw at best. The laws that enabled a lot of them to do what they did were passed before they did it, but their actions did spur a lot of further action. 

* 5. *Sexual Revolution*

http://historyofsexuality.umwblogs.org/mid-to-late-20th-century/the-sexual-revolution/

http://www.alternet.org/story/153969/how_the_sexual_revolution_changed_america_forever

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfred_Kinsey#Sexology

http://img.thebody.com/cdc/2010/graph-lg.gif

This one I also call a draw, on several grounds. First, Alfred Kinsey decidedly started the revolution in the 50's with his controversial research and he was decidedly NOT a boomer. The Revolution actually started closer to the mid-1930's and 40's, but Kinsey publishing  Sexual Behavior in the Human Male (1948) and Sexual Behavior in the Human Female (1953), also known as the Kinsey Reports, as well as the Kinsey scale set of a huge spark in the revolution. So the boomers didn't really ""start"" the revolution, but it did explode under their care. 

On the other hand, the spread of HIV infections peaked in the 80's, as they matured but had minimal information on HIV and AIDS. Not to mention the wide spread of other STD's that still plague our nation (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2598671/bin/st26245.f6.gif)

So on the grounds that they didn't start it, and their expansion was so uninformed about it as to wide spread disease for several generations, I'm calling this one a draw. We have more liberties and understanding but at the cost of disease and death.

* 6. *Technology*

http://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/inventions/who-invented-the-computer1.htm

So yes/no here also. A lot of the technology began in it's infancy long before the boomers got a hold of it, but they did take technologies very very far. They took computers from number crunching machines to what they are now (Thanks Gates and Jobs!). They created the wireless systems that we all now enjoy and updated the phones that we use. I wouldn't say they invented the ideas for a lot of technology, but they absolutely expanded that technology. Our generation, including Mark Zuckerberg, is currently using those technologies to revolutionize communication. This is a resounding YES for the boomers. They have given vast new ways to communicate and widely opened technology. 

* 7. *The Cold War*

http://faculty.washington.edu/qtaylor/a_us_history/cold_war_timeline.htm

Um...half of the cold war was over before the boomers reached 18 years old. Most of politics was run by the Silent Generation still. This is a resounding no. While there were contributions that happened to wrap things up toward the late 70's and 80's, most of it happened because of some very heavy lifting on the hands of the generation before the boomers and them doing things that we would never consider ethical. 

* 8. *Fixed Polio*

http://renekratz.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/eid_lec8_slide47-medium.jpg

The Polio cases and vaccines happened while boomers were alive, but not when they were in power. It was again the Silent Generation who came up with most of the cures for these problems and consequently the cases drastically reduced in the 50's. This is like 3/4 no, but also 1/4 yes, because the Boomers did create more versions of it and standardize the use of it. 

* 9. *Established better retirement*

http://www.commonwealthfund.org/Publications/In-the-Literature/2006/Apr/Twenty-Common-Nursing-Home-Problems-and-the-Laws-to-Resolve-Them.aspx

http://www.socialsecurityreform.org/problem/index.cfm

http://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-real-reason-behind-social-securitys-problems/

Boomers have done a ton to bolster social security and set up nursing homes. The problem is that since they have put their parents in these nursing homes there is a wild flurry for how horrible those places are. In addition, there were a lot of gaps in Social Security that caused problems for their parents. They have moved to fix those holes, but haven't chipped anything more into the pot while beginning to already cash out. So they fixed a system for themselves and are now depleting it while not likely to go into the said homes that they created for their parents. This is also a resounding failure. 

**CONCLUSION**

Based on all of the observable problems that have been created by leaders from that generation (not during their generation, mind you, but BY MEMBERS OF their generation), the lackluster performance of a bulk of their important contributions, and the very self-absorbed nature of a lot of the mindsets I am currently of the opinion that they are actually (as a collective) the problem with progress. This doesn't mean there aren't great people in the generation who did great things. It means that the bad things they allowed their leaders to do and voted those leaders in for, drastically outweigh the benefits of the good things they did by marching and so on. I don't think the bulk of the generation had ill intentions or is that greedy, but undoubtedly the major influencing powers from the generation have left a generation of greed, selfishness, and personal ambition at the expense of anything else. 

Feel free to show me wrong. I am more than happy to hear about all of the definitive evidence about how they did great things and did NOT cause most of the problems we have today. 

**Disclaimer: I might come off as smug but I just speak in a more matter-of-fact tone. I'm always open to other opinions as long as they are actually supported and not inane statements like, ""I don't need a source because I was there.""**

t3_a49ga5	"CMV: Positivism solves problems. If the humanities refuse to adapt positivist methodologies, they're creating stories, not science."	"*I apologise if the following is a bit simplistic, but I wanted to give my view in a concise form :-)*


Solving a problem is essentially making better decisions. For a decision to be good, it should produce the outcome we want. To know which decision is good, then, we need to know which outcomes it produces. To know this, we need theories that make accurate predictions.

In the humanities, theories are tested against academic consensus or the feelings of the researcher, if they're tested at all. Often, they don't make predictions that are testable. Therefore we don't know whether they're accurate. If we don't know whether they're accurate, or they don't make predictions, they can't solve problems.

As an alternative, the natural sciences validate the predictions of their theories on data collected from the real world. If the predictions don't fit the data, the model must change to become more accurate. These same methodologies can be used on humans, eg. experimental psychology.

If the humanities are to be accepted as a science and continue receiving funding in socialist countries, they should adapt these methods so they can improve decision making. Otherwise, they should be recognized as narrative subjects, not science.

Not everyone holds this view, as an example (translated from Danish):

t3_596aon	CMV: Humans should collectively work toward a significantly reduced population.	"There are plenty of people on the planet, and I hope they all live happy full lives and can experience the wonder of our planet. Which is part of why I would hope that we can take the steps to control our population better. A reduced human population exacerbates no problems and could alleviate some of the 'pressure' on existing problems. On the simplest level, less humans require less resources & space. We could pull back some of our sprawl, return parking lots to natural habitats.

In the history of humanity, the opportunity for this is unprecedented. This is the first time that we could not only see the problem of over growth but be in a position to develop a unified plan and message that can be spread globally.

t3_33vbdk	"CMV:I believe this is the last century with humans civilisation on earth if we continue our ""progress"""	"The recent progress - or whatever you might call it -  of human science and engineering is pushing the human civilisation over the edge of existing in 100 years.

1. We not only destroy our planet in every way imaginable we are proud of it. 
Droughts and floods will make large parts of the world uninhabitable. 
The usage of fossil fuels will heaten up the earth that parts of world are sunk (goodby pacific islands).
Excessive usage of vaccancies on our food objects is building up restistent viruses we dont have cures against.
    
 I dont mean to say that there will be no humans left. Im just worried that civilisation as we have it rigth now will stop at some point. I am feared of mass extinction of humans like we are doing with animals right now.

2. Automatisation will make a huge portion of human labor obsolete even faster. If we dont find ways as a society to cope with extrem high jobless rates we will face rebellions and revolutions like last seen in the 18. century.

t3_2v79r4	CMV: The fundamental problems of capitalism are caused by a too-short time horizon.	"Currently, people around the world, from the elites at Davos to the common voter, are troubled by issues such as inequality and climate change but have no real idea how to fix them. I think that all of these problems fundamentally originate from the short time horizon associated with capitalism, an overly high discount rate, and an inability to think beyond the 5-10 year lifecycle of a fund.

For instance,

Climate change and the use of scarce resources: Scientists generally agree that we need to leave a certain percentage of fossil fuels in the ground to avoid economically-destabilizing levels of climate change. Leaving fossil fuels in the ground is also wise for future generations in the event that renewable energy is a disappointment. However, few oil and coal companies are willing to look over a 20+ year horizon and they seem incapable of realizing that extracting all the oil that is economically feasible will be destructive to the global economy, including their own bottom line, in the medium term.

Inequality: High levels of inequality are generally bad for everyone over the long run as even elites face the threat of violence, populist politics including Marxism and Chavismo, and civil unrest. In addition, in the long run inequality makes it difficult for elites to find qualified employees and large markets for luxury goods; hence, we see that the elites of highly unequal countries like Brazil, Venezuela, and South Africa have a propensity to emigrate to less unequal countries like the US/Canada, European countries, and (in the case of South Africans) Australia.

The basic problem is that capitalism *as it exists now* is incapable of preventing things that are destructive in the long run. To speak economics, the discount rate is too high for people and firms to do what is in their long-run best interests.

t3_ev77hi	CMV: Self driving cars won't change the world	"There is a lot of hype about self driving cars recently. I think it's not true: self driving cars are just a cheap Uber, and Uber's existence didn't really change the world -- after all, an Uber is just a cheap taxi, and taxis have been around forever.

&#x200B;

Some technology -- the computer, the internet, to a lesser extent the cell phone -- undoubtedly had an enormous impact on the world, because they changed the way that people do their jobs every day, consume entertainment, and interact with each other. Self driving cars will have a big impact on people who drive for a living, but otherwise the change to people's everyday life will be relatively small."	1

t3_c8zn71	CMV: Global environmental problems are ultimately resulted by greed via population growth.	"[https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/05/17/the-correlation-between-global-population-and-global-co2/](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2016/05/17/the-correlation-between-global-population-and-global-co2/)

[https://overpopulation-project.com/population-growth-is-a-threat-to-the-worlds-climate/](https://overpopulation-project.com/population-growth-is-a-threat-to-the-worlds-climate/)

The first article doesn't really support my position, as it provides 3 more possible explanations for the correlation, while the second one has a very strong stance, so make of them what you would. My view is not based on them, but more of a 'belief' through my observation, so no point would be given for argument about the articles, they are just supporting.

&#x200B;

You can actually split my view into 2 parts: environmental problems are resulted by population growth and the population growth is not being tackled because of greed, you could address one without the other.

&#x200B;

For the first part, I'm just gonna be lazy and copy from the first article although it doesn't come with a strong conviction: ""Population causes CO2. This is ‘obvious’ explanation that most people would give. The more people there are on our planet, the more CO2-generating activities there will be, such as electrical power generation, industrial activity, automobiles, cooking fires, and so on.""

Second part: greed. A shrinking population would mean a shrinking wallet for the corporations; a maintained population would mean no record turnover and profit (of course it's still possible, just harder), meaning no soaring share price, again, a shrinking wallet relatively. Therefore it should not be surprising that while corporations pledge to reduce their CO2 emission, you have never heard about them addressing the population problem. 

If you thought I was merely gonna criticize the corporations.. the greed doesn't only lie in the corporations and the people behind them. We\* had - and still have - conservatism that prohibits contraception for various reasons, chief among them is so we can go to a place no one is proven to have ever been and then return safely. No longer do we want to subject ourselves to the daily physical slug that might weaken us and shorten our life span just to grow our own food. We want to taste food from the other side of the planet, even if they are not native to our diet and sometimes even causes allergy, either by having them delivered to our doorstep or being there physically (and there's that too). All those are just a few examples of greed: to be immortal, to have a less physically daunting - hence 'easier' life, to Live Life^(TM).

\*: as in human as a species, generally, there is no way everyone of us could have lived from 1800 till now, when the population booms from 1 bil to 7.6 bil.

I do not wish to discuss the solution because that in itself deserve another discussion. Also it's because frankly I do not know how to solve it, but I believe not having any solutions to a problem identified doesn't mean that problem is not a real problem."	1	
t3_em0las	"CMV: Committees in the House and Senate Should be Run by Actual Scientists, Economists, and Experts"	"We see in several committees that politicians run them, not experts in said field. At times, these politicians may not even have any knowledge, a lack of knowledge, or have agendas that hurt whatever committee they're in. Some of them have no idea what they're talking about. For example,  Lamar Smith was a Republican who was a chairman in the Committee of Science, Space, and Technology. He had a very anti-science approach and did not believe in climate change, and tried to suppress climate scientists.

Because of this, these committees should be run by actual experts. Like the committee of science should be run by scientists. The cybersecurity subcommittee should be run by cybersecurity experts. The Armed Services committee should be run by those who served in the armed services. 

Politicians won't be able to run these committees, even if they were an expert in the field. But they can advise the current experts in the committee. This is to prevent corruption. This way, we won't have politicians denying climate change and being a chairman in the committee of science."	1

t3_pgfx6b	cmv: Oil is Abiotic and is not a fossil fuel	"ESL: I remember first hearing about the abiotic oil theory as a joke but honestly it ends up making more sense the more I investigated it, basically the abiotic oil theory states that the oil we extract from the Earth did not have living precursor, be that algae, plankton or Dinosaurs but instead is created beneath the Earth Crust, similarly to how Lava erupts due to the created immense pressure and decay of nuclear elements in the centre of the earth, and the convection of Magma leading to the surface. Is it not too feasible that liquid hydrocarbons can also be created and transported in the similar way?

I have a few points that can raise some questions or make you think, if you can refute this go ahead

* According to google, we globally consume  **97,103,871 barrels per day** of oil, now to put that in perspective, the weight of a single barrel of oil is approximately 135kg, thats over **Ten million tons** a day, and that trend has kept approximately the same for the past decade or so, so we can assume that an unfathomable mass of oil has been extracted from the earth since Humanity has been alive, but according to the biogenic oil theory we're told to believe that oil comes from dead &decaying plankton, algae, vegetation and dinosaurs over the past  **3.7 billion years** which to me doesn't really add up, how many billions of ton of life would have to die and not be reincorporated into the natural cycle, then sink and decay in order for this to occur and supply what oil we could extract, It makes more sense that hydrocarbons from the stars that ended up inside the earth and merely leaks back to the top, just like Magma
* Please remember that the ""organic"" when referring to molecule means that it has a Carbon-Hydrogen bond, not that it came from life. The composition of crude hydrocarbons taken from the earth itself contain many toxic elements and compounds, such as vanadium and mercury, can anybody find any sort of biomarkers or indication of life from anything in oil, any trace at all? I mean any DNA or plant matter would've degraded so its rather a moot point
* Depth oil can be found VS Depth fossils have been discovered, now I understand we may not be able to find any fossils in certain areas due to technical limitations, but considering how the layers of the Earth are we can estimate how deep something will sink over time, the deepest fossil we've discovered was found at 2256 metres while the deepest oil well we've pumped up was 10,683 metres, thats over 4x as deep, now there are lifeforms at the bottom of the sea but they themselves are supported by (guess what) hydrocarbons and sulphur vents coming from cracks in the Ocean, tell me where all that methane comes from? So far the deepest life we've discovered is ""One microorganism called Desulforudis audaxviator was discovered nearly two miles (3.2km) below the Earth’s surface"" so even if we had a colony of extremophiles underneath the earth that still wouldn't be enough to be responsible for all that earth, we can assume that some point, perhaps 5km under the earth life will be completely sterile and nothing living will exist
* Presence of extraterrestrial oil, just check the NASA website or the many articles, there's plenty of oil that's been discovered on place like Mars or Saturn, infact Titan has more crude oil on its surface the Earth does entirely(I think) also the presence of oil on Asteroids and Comets has been confirmed, are we really saying that Earth is the only planet has its oil come from biogenic sources like algae and microorganism while everything else in the solar system has its abiotic oil  hydrocarbons from other sources like stars?
* Location oil wells are found in, we can find oil wells in non-porous rock, meaning that no oil could seep in from above , remember that fossils are usually only found in sedimentary rocks, yet oil deposits can be found in oil can be found in metamorphic and igneous rocks(we can't find fossils in igneous rocks, they get melted to magma) so where did all that oil come from? if not biological matter then what? We also observe some oil reserves, previously depleted to be replenishing itself, if true that this oil came from natural life then this would take millions and millions of dead creatures and millions of years to decay to seep into the oil wells, opposed to oil from deep within the earth seeping back up
* I understand other fuel sources are genuine fossil fuels like peatbog and coal, derived from living matter but there are much larger deposits of oil then all the other sources found
* The processes of the earth which constantly pushes Magma to the surface and creates volcanoes, the immense heat and pressure, the decay of nuclear elements at the planets core and the raw materials within the earth from broken stars can all produce a multitude of chemical reactions we still don't understand, and we know that these processes can form and push magma up to the surface of the earth creating lava and volcanoes, is it that much of a jump to think the crude oil, hydrocarbons can also be produced from carbon and hydrogen in the earth crust can be pushed into oil wells and other deposits?

Anyways please let me know you think about it, and Im interested in how my points will be refuted"	1	
t3_9uh6mr	CMV: The developed world should consider itself responsible for emissions generated by the developing world in the process of producing goods for consumption by the developed world	"We see a lot of discussion in context of emissions footprints of the large footprints of countries that have strongly export-driven economies. However, I'd hold that when it comes to nations that bear responsibility for emissions, much of the emissions footprint of the developed world is made artificially low by effectively outsourcing production (and the associated emissions) to other countries. If all the stuff that the US consumes that is produced in China were instead produced in the US, the relative emissions footprints of the two countries would likely be significantly different.

To be clear, absolute emissions numbers (CO2 or CO2e), while interesting, are not super relevant to this view, which is that country A bears responsibility for greenhouse gases emitted by country B in response to demand from country A.

These taxes would perform no differently then tobacco or alcohol taxes, with the primary goal of funding less expensive water conservation efforts and to help focus the public on using public tap water available for fractions of the cost of bottled water sources. These taxes should also be used to improve water conditions for all citizens and expanding tab sources for regions where tap water is not available or unsafe. 

In the event of national emergencies this tax would be reimbursed or temporarily removed to accommodate the areas needing an external source of water. 

A measure like this would provide increased funds to make tab and public water sources more efficient, even less expensive, and more widespread.

t3_8ikc67	"CMV:Despite the ""big government sucks!"" rhetoric, the American right wing is pretty authoritarian, and their policy generally is pro-government."	"As with any group, I'll begin this with saying that not all conservatives or republicans fit this description. I'll also say that a lot of these issues exist with the democratic party as well. I'm not here to debate whether a policy is just or favorable or anything. I'm simply talking about whether said policy is objectively authoritarian, libertarian, pro government, anti government, etc. 

That being said, I know that ever since the Obama administration, the call of the republican party, the tea party, fox news, and any others on that part of the spectrum has been ""stop big government"". Back during Obama, there was some truth to those factions being opposed to big government in some regards. There was the trend of filming police to expose injustice, opposition to the NSA, gun rights, tax cuts, etc. 

However, as time went on, this started to change. I first noticed this shift when the ""blue lives matter"" campaign started. The idea that working for the government and carrying a gun makes you some kind of hero is directly oppositional to the idea of libertarian small government. Its even more authoritarian to use a narrative that police officers are some kind of marginalized group that faces discrimination because of their job. What I get out of that kind of rhetoric is ""don't question authority, don't hold the powerful accountable for their actions. Cooperate with them and thank them for keeping you safe"". I don't see any way that this kind of movement could be considered pro liberty, or pro small government. You've all seen taxpayer money going to armorized tanks rolling down the street, and SWAT teams breaking down doors stealing drugs, money and guns. (Yes, theyre taking your guns, google Baltimore raids). Some may argue that this much government control is ""a necessary evil"" or ""the lesser of evils"" or even that its morally just for whatever reason. But I dont see any way one could deny that it is authoritarian, or at least that its just as much ""big government"" as partially subsidized healthcare is. 

I also took notice of the policies proposed in response to terrorist attacks. Travel bans, ICE raids, outright Muslim bans, stop and frisk, etc. Once again, some may argue that these are necessary, but how can anyone deny theyre objectively authoritarian?

Then there's abortion policy. The amount of legal restrictions on womens bodies that have been proposed over the years.....I could go on for so long, but I think you get what I mean. 

Gay marriage is a big one, too. I know that now as opposed to 10 years ago, the Republican party has become less opposed to gay marriage, and theres a whole lot of LGBT republicans. However, the anti-gay rhetoric still is present in this tangent of the right, and the idea that the government can tell 2 adults they cannot be married doesn't seem to fit the ""American freedom"" rhetoric. 

I am not trying to debate whether these policies are right or wrong (though I'm sure you know where I stand on them). I'm just curious to know in what ways these policies and positions correlate to the libertarian, small government, principles of the American right. I'm well aware that democrats have pushed the exact same policies at times, but the right does this while fearmongering about ""big government!! taxes are socialism!!"" etc. Because the way it looks to me right now, is that either 
-""big government"" in the context of these factions means subsidized healthcare or education, gun control, and censorship. Also, that ""civil liberties"" only covers the freedom to say racial slurs, the right for some people to carry firearms, low taxes, and legal weed. 
or that 
-This tangent of the right knows that their policy, is in many ways in support of a strong government, and is ok with high taxes, so long as they're not going to welfare or healthcare. Yet some groups continue to use this ""stop socialist big government"" rhetoric to support the narrative of the right as the rebel underdogs fighting the establishment. 

Maybe somebody will have a point that makes me change my view, or maybe I'll just get called a commie cuck or something, lets see. "	1	
t3_246fph	"CMV: I think that statements like ""Humanity has an ethical obligation to expand to other planets to ensure the survival of the species"" are ridiculous."	"I've heard a lot of people say that humanity will in the future expand into space. I'm not commenting on whether or not that will happen (personally I don't think that large scale extraterrestrial colonisation will occur but leaving that aside for the moment), I'm objecting to the idea that we have an *ethical obligation* to do so. I believe that ethics applies to individuals, that we can only have ethical obligations to other persons (be they human or non-human), and that ethics cannot be applied to non-person concepts such as a species. 

One argument commonly trotted out is that, if we remain confined to Earth, then a meteor strike or some other calamity could wipe out our species. I agree that this is the case. I also agree that everyone on Earth dying would be an undesirable outcome, thus we can characterise steps taken to avoid this eventually as ethically good. However I get confused when supporters of extraterrestrial colonisation make arguments along the lines of: everyone on Earth dying is bad, therefore we should colonise space. In my mind, this is a non sequitur. I don't see how having people living on Mars makes everyone on Earth dying any less bad. One could argue that having people living on Mars means that less people live on Earth, hence less people would die, but I don't accept this argument as it is likely that colonisation efforts would not have a significant effect on the population of Earth, just as the English colonisation of North America did not have a significant effect on the population of England; changes in population tend to be driven by large scale effects, such as famine or, conversely, abundance of food.

One could also argue that we could see the meteor coming, and evacuate people to Mars such that less people die. I also thing that it is highly unlikely that a significant proportion of the Earth's population could be evacuated in the time we had before an impact. In any case, this argument fails because there will almost certainly be far cheaper and more effective meteor mitigation strategies. Other disasters that could befall the Earth, such as dangerous climate change, could be a reason to try to slowly evacuate humans to another planet, say, over the course of a century, but again this seems like an overly extreme and expensive way of dealing with the problem.

So, to reiterate, I think that it is ridiculous to argue that we have an *ethical obligation* to colonise space, because *there is no ethical obligation to continue the human species*. There are obligations that we have to other humans, but not to the species as a whole.

t3_n62crf	Cmv: Nuclear energy is just the best	"At least for the near future, i think nuclear might even be able to power us relativly cleanly untill we get stuff like dison spheres.

A lot of people are still scared of nuclear energy but i think that is nonsense. They think about events like Tjernobyl, but in reality, even though this whas the biggest nuclear disaster ever, only 31 people died directly and a couple thousand due to bad evacuation later. This may sound like a lot, but it is estimated that about 1.5 to 2 million people died due to Co2 intake. 

Second, the nuclear waste.
First, generators produce less and less waste then before. Ways are also being found to make a reactot that doesnt just not produce nuclear wastez but using it. And what sounds better to you, pumping tons of dangerous material into the air that we breathe, or locking way less but more dangerous waste in a bunker deep underground untill we find a way to use it? 

Those that say; ""renewable energy doesnt produce any waste"" renewables are too expensive to make companies use them, they take up huge areas for the same energy, also destroying the enviroment. And building a wind turbine (melting metal amd such) emits 2.2 tonnes of Co2."	1	
t3_cedu4k	CMV: We are doomed	"Ok, I may be a bit cynical at the moment, having witnessed several ""recycling"" bins filled with general trash but this has been festering for a while. I grew up thinking about our impact in the world (thanks Captain Planet!) and have always been careful about my buying and consumption habits. I try to be careful about my recycling ensuring it is properly segregated with the hope that the majority of the world does so too.

&#x200B;

I've been feeling all of this is like pissing into a fan.

a) People don't give a shit. In my workplace, my educated colleagues can't seem to be able to differentiate between a bag with a half eaten sandwich and a drink bottle and dispose both the general waste and recycling bins. It's as if the bins do not have a colour or a label.

I keep my recycling bins out for collection and when I sneak a peek the next morning before the trucks arrived, they're filled up with some mystery junk from the people renovating their house the next door who can't be half arsed to dispose of their construction waste responsibly.

I see recycling dumpsters filled with general waste outside supermarkets and restaurants. ""We recycled 1000 tons last year"". Nope, that was a 1000 tons of garbage that went to the recycling centre and gummed up the works. 

b) Companies don't give a shit. For all the feel good stories about reducing plastic by banning straws etc., there are tons of cheap and poor quality stuff produced that is bought for short term use and does not last. Every single day, my news feed has some article about ""The 10 things from \*Mart that you must buy"". Hell no. None of this is needed. I saw a ""news"" article about cheap pans from KMart that were must haves because they look like $150 designer ones but don't quite last that long. The lady said these last about a year with decent care so it's best to stock up. Nothing about the hundreds of thousands of pans that will go to the tip in a years time.

We use virgin paper to wipe our asses and flush it down the toilet. Virgin plastic to make bottles which get used once and thrown away. Why? Is it so hard to recycle materials?

c) All the stuff we ""recycle"" goes to the waste collection centre where they to do deal with the mess that we cause \[a\]. Most are ill equipped to sort stuff in a manner that results in a high quality recyclable mass which makes sense for a processor to recycle. We used to send all of this to China and other countries but they've had enough and there's enough of the same stuff they have to deal with anyway. All of this is now piled up in giant warehouses, waiting for the next toxic fire ""accident"" or is just being dumped into the landfill.

&#x200B;

... I'm sorry. I can't think straight and didn't intend for this to be a rant that started with recycling and ended up with consumption. I like to think that the people in charge have long term plans for our survival but apparently, long term is relative. All we can think of is the next 5, 10 or even 100 years. We have lived for over 200,000 years and in the span of two centuries, we have screwed up our land, air, water and almost every other species. We've somehow managed to exhaust oil at a planetary level and have barely enough to last for the next 50 years. It would be a fitting end if our only hope for survival rests in some future technology that requires oil and we have none of it.

t3_43l5iq	CMV: P1: The Sun revolves around the Earth. P2: The Earth revolves around the Sun. Both are equally true propositions.	"

It all depends on perspective. Taken on a purely observational level, how can anyone deny that the Sun is moving across the sky as one looks up throughout the day? Your initial reaction will probably be to point out, quite correctly, that the Sun's travel across the sky is but an apparent motion caused by the rotation of the Earth. With this I do not disagree. My contention, instead, is that there is no one fixed way the world is and that therefore there is no objective basis upon which to privilege one perspective over another. Hence, P1 and P2 are equally true. 

The most compelling explanation that I can see for why certain paradigms prevail at certain times has nothing to do with truth, or with the way the world ""actually is"", but is instead an instrumental explanation: we give epistemological priority to those theories that allow us to make better, cleaner, broader and more reliable predictions. Indeed, historically that was a primary driver for the eventual widespread adoption of the Copernican model, that is, its superior utility in ocean navigation during the age of discovery over the ptolemaic system.

But one could easily imagine a hypothetical future wherein new scientific models of the universe with superior utility for the purposes of interstellar space travel results in the abandonment of classical heliocentrism (after all, if Science is anything, it is a succession of abandoned theories). People would look back and laugh at our naive notion that the Earth revolved around a stationary Sun, just as we now scoff at the naive proposition that the Sun revolves around the Earth. From that even wider future perspective, the Earths motion around the Sun would be just another beguiling form of apparent motion, and the actual state of affairs, from their ""advanced"" point of view, would be something we can't even imagine. 

Across all three -- the geocentric, heliocentric, and the hypothetical future model -- one can discern no progress being made toward ascertaining the way the world actually is.

t3_olry48	"CMV: Residents of California should be planting more trees, grass, and foliage, as well as continuing to irrigate versus transitioning to desertscape/xeriscapes with zero to little irrigation. We are currently accelerating the transition to a desert enviroment."	"We are doing the opposite of what we should be doing. We have all seen the stories of the people that have planted billions of trees and plants which has changed deserts into rainforests (or close to rainforests, depending on geographical location). 


In California we are doing the opposite. Tearing our plant life and replacing it with artificial turf, rocks, mulch, etc. which is a self fulfilling prophecy. If we make our environment into a desert it will become a desert. 


For those that are going to say California is a desert already and it is just returning to its natural state, I disagree as California’s environment is extremely diverse and is mostly temperate- including rainforests. 


Yes, we are also in a drought and have been for many years (with some years of respite). But our transition to desertscape or xeriscape will only cause the drought to become worse, more frequent, and possibly permanent.  Irrigation is our only option now to try and reverse the damage already done. 


Where is the water going to come from? We need more water storage during wet times. Meaning more reservoirs and dams… not popular but we can’t keep drilling wells and draining our aquifers. 


TLDR: Plant a shit ton of real trees, grasses, and other foliage, and water the hell out of it to keep California from turning into a desert. As well as building more water storage to support irrigation needs."	1	
t3_asnjcf	"CMV: Humanity has yet to master or even invent a form of government/economy that would sustain us as a species, on a massive scale, indefinitely, in outer space."	"First, let’s presume a few things:

1.) Humanity will eventually have to venture off this planet if we are to survive as a species because Earth is a very volatile place and could eradicate us fairly easily given the long view of its history. 

2.) We have mastered the technology to create and maintain massive self contained environments powered by finite and renewable resources, whether they be large scale space stations, or planetary habitats. 

3.) We have mastered medicine, agriculture, and any other technologies required for our species to flourish and survive indefinitely in such an environment. 

      I hold this view because we do, in a way, already live on a sort of space station, with finite and renewable resources, and seem to be living in a very unsustainable way. I see our time here on Earth as a sort of practice run for the big game out amongst the starts I guess. As of right now, we don’t stand a chance, specifically in terms of governing people and economies in a mutually beneficial and sustainable manner.

t3_1d0bmb	"The most important function of government is stewardship, and Libertarianism is bankrupt because it doesn't account for this. CMV"	"It's often stated that the most important function of government is security, but I disagree with this - it's actually *stewardship* that is the most important function. After all, what good is keeping the current generation safe if we use up all of our resources doing so, leaving nothing for the next generation?

Conservation of our natural (and intellectual, industrial, etc.) resources is a task the government is uniquely suited for.  In a free market environment such as the one coveted by Libertarians and AnCaps, everyone is essentially out for themselves, and are encouraged to consume as much of our resources as they can if they feel it can give them some sort of advantage.  No one is tasked with watching out for future generations - no one has the power to make people stop burning oil and burning the rain forests because it doesn't necessarily cause harm to this generation, even though it could devastate our future generations.  

The only incentive, ecologically, for stewardship in a market environment is watching out for your direct descendants, but if everyone is only watching out for themself and theirs, there's still a massive incentive to slash and burn the environment, etc. if it provides wealth.  After all, if your descendants are only paying one ten-billionth of the cost but reaping the entire benefit, you are still incentivized to consume and not conserve.

Governments, because they (at least are intended to) last many generations, have skin in the game on preserving natural, intellectual, industrial, etc. resources for the future.  Additionally, by virtue of being composed of the whole population, they don't have the same ""privatized profit, socialized loss"" mechanism that individuals have, because they instead balance socialized profit vs. socialized loss.

I can't claim that government always does a perfect job of stewardship, but at least ""big government"" HAS A MECHANISM IN PLACE that **can** rationally practice stewardship.  Libertarianism, by its very nature, **does not** preserve stewardship and thus cannot form a solid long-term basis for a high-functioning society.

**UPDATE:** Thanks everyone for the great discussion!  Unfortunately, I did not see any posters give any concrete answers for how a libertarian society can protect future generations, so I cannot yet award a delta.  The closest that I came to being swayed is the suggestion that class-action lawsuits could be taken against offenders, HOWEVER, with no proposed way that class-action lawsuits could be taken on behalf of future persons, even this solution fails the test of stewardship.

I feel that the most common response to my post was ""current states don't do a good job of stewardship either."" While this may be true, it doesn't alter my claim that a libertarian society **cannot** do a good job of stewardship, whereas a state with a relatively forward-thinking leadership could do an effective job. The fact that most current states do a poor job doesn't excuse the fact that a Libertarian government would institutionalize a complete lack of stewardship *as part of its fundamental mechanism, the free market.*  FURTHERMORE, I believe that environmental conservation laws, when they have been passed, have been extremely effective at reducing pollution of rivers, reducing smog, improving efficiency standards, and preserving our natural landscape.  My conclusion is that IF the political will exists, a strong state can do an excellent job of stewardship, so the fundamental problem comes not from the functioning of the state, but from the mobilization of political public sentiment.  Thus, while market-based solutions cannot possibly protect future generations (and I'm still open to being swayed on that claim,) a strong government has a clear way to provide the necessary stewardship, and further efforts should be made at the level of education, organization, and mobilization of citizens concerned with stewardship and sustainability, rather than requiring any sort of overhaul of government."	1	
t3_oxr10e	CMV: The problem isn't that Lizard People are running various world governments. The problem is that they're not doing a good enough job.	"I've become aware of a fascinating conspiracy theory that Lizard People run various governments--the United States of America, etc. 

Always, the operating assumption is that this is bad specifically because they are Lizard People. I find this close minded and offensive. We shouldn't be biased against Lizard People per se anymore than we should be biased against people based on skin color or gender: it's their biology, and not fair to hold against them. 

However, if Lizard People really are running, say, the United States (my country, which will be my focus because I have the most insight into it) government, a very fair objection is that they're simply not very competent. 

I'd rather not focus on my specific views on what exactly the government is doing wrong (that would be a different CMV)--in this polarized age, one thing both ends of the political spectrum happen to agree on is that the government isn't functioning at a high level. So I won't dive into that here.

I foresee some objections:

(1) It's bad that the Lizard People are leading the government because they aren't citizens and so have no right to lead. My counter: in conspiracy theories I've seen, no one denies the Lizard People live among us, in which case they should, by birth right, have citizenship. If they've been denied proper citizenship due to specie-ism, I'm not going to hold that against them as it is inherently unjust.

(2) The Lizard People are only doing a bad job for humans because they hate humans and only want what's best for lizards, which shows they should never be in positions of authority.  My counter: if this were true, we should see some evidence that they're implementing pro-lizard policies. In fact, we see just the opposite. The United States, for instance, has not done nearly enough to combat climate change, which scientist point out is especially hard on lizards ([https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/05/492713407/for-lizards-climate-change-is-a-deadly-and-complex-threat](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/05/492713407/for-lizards-climate-change-is-a-deadly-and-complex-threat))

(3) Lizard People are subhuman and gross and we should hate them. Warm blood good, cold blood bad! My counter: come on. Aren't we better than that? These are not morally or ethically defensible positions.

As an alternate approach to hating Lizard People because they're reptilian, I would argue for a more objective, even handed, less specie-ist/racist approach: we should hold the Lizard People accountable for poor governance.  The polarization of politics, lack of progress on poverty, unjust taxation schemes, poorly organized pandemic response, increasing budget deficits with seemingly no real strategy or goal, comparably worse health care than other countries, and impotence in the face of the global catastrophe of climate change all point to poor policy decisions on the part of the Lizard People. Working together, we can build a better future. One in which humanoids are judged not based on their body temperature, presence of scales, and ability to lay eggs, but on the content of their character and ability to competently govern and participate in the civic process."	1	
t3_oya21l	"Cmv: There is no definition of evil or evil act that cannot be explained through: mental illnesses, normal characteristics of the human mind, situations external to the person, altered mental state or all before therefore evil as such does not exist and therefore neither does good"	"Basically evil does not exist because we cannot even define it in such a way that we are not defining something else that also conflicts with what evil is 

And since evil does not exist, good as its opposite would not exist either, in addition to a person may be evil that would require his full conscious knowledge of the results of his actions and that would require omnipotence. 

Otherwise if we do not know the full results of our actions our ability to exercise evil is limited by the unexpected nature of the long-term results, and if we consider the knowledge of the consequences unnecessary that would make the mentally ill, babies and animals could be considered evil for their actions


At an evolutionary level, evil does not make sense, to what kind of species it would be beneficial if an individual begins to actively harm the other members of his species, for no reason other than the desire to do so, especially a species as social as ours to the point that it is considered that the empathic capacity of our species played an essential role in our survival in the caves, 

there has not been a substantial change in the functioning of primitive humanity to actual humanity, who are even known to care for their sick better than we do

So there are two explanations, either the human species is losing the ability to empathize and therefore be good for unknown reasons that go against our evolutionary path of the last millions of years or the concept of evil is meaningless and duality of good and evil (a concept created by humans and not as old as many believe) is currently harmful to society by preventing us from empathizing with the supposed evil"	1	
t3_9u8dqv	CMV: Nuclear energy is the only short term solution to the environmental problems we face	"Right now we have a huge problem with the amount of fossil fuel used for energy. I'm not only talking about China and India, but also in the West. In Europe and the USA we are still extremely reliant on oil, gas or coal. 

[Here](https://qz.com/1193603/two-countries-are-the-reason-the-eu-is-hitting-its-ambitious-renewable-energy-targets/) you can see even thought the amount of renewable energy that is produced is going up in Europe, the CO2 output is still increasing. 

[The worldwide energy consumption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worldwide_energy_supply#Primary_energy_production) is far worse. In 2013 barely 1% of our total energy consumption was renewable. To make matters worse there has been an insane drop of [animal species all around the world](https://edition.cnn.com/2018/10/29/health/wwf-wildlife-population-report-intl/index.html?no-st=1541373101). Many experts are saying we are reaching the point of no return really fast.

So what is the solution to this problem, what can we do short term to battle the climate change and animal extinction we are facing, the answer is nuclear power. Nuclear power can generate more power on short term, than any renewable energy source without any CO2 emission. Now it's clear it has disadvantages, it's not a magical solution. You have nuclear trash and other dangers that could potentially be devastating. But even keeping all that in mind the amount of energy it would produce versus the radioactive trash and possible casualties, it would still be more beneficial for the environment by a long shot, compared to fossil fuels.

TL;DR Nuclear energy is the intermediate step we need to stop climate change, before fully switching too renewable energy.

[A new report from the IPCC actually indicates if we want the use the amount of electricity we have now, to meet our desires we need up to 6x the amount of nuclear energy we have now](http://www.ipcc.ch/report/sr15/). For the people that don't know the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change."	1	
t3_bztzr6	CMV: leftist redistributive policies might not work economically	"I lean pretty far to the left, but I'll admit that I don't know much about economics.  I think the whole left/right opposition is really one of subjective values – a privileging of the collective over the individual, or vice versa – so I don't really think economic facts will change my political orientation.  However, I do wonder whether certain economic premises are accurate and whether certain policy solutions espoused by the left would work as intended.  The questions I have are:

Is there really wage stagnation?  I recall hearing that wages have actually been rising, it's just that the compensation has shifted towards benefits like retirement and healthcare.  But is wage growth, including benefit compensation, keeping up with costs of living?

What are the long-term concerns about widening income disparity?  If capital is reinvested to create market growth and jobs, does it matter if that capital is only being invested by very few people?  Is growing income disparity linked to wage stagnation?

Is the problem perhaps that the wealthy are spending more on luxury and less on capital investment?  If so, what are the long-term effects of increased luxury spending?  Aren't you still getting money back into the economy via the purchase of luxury commodities?

I am *anecdotally* certain that people can't actually live working full-time on minimum wage – at least not where I live, the numbers just don't add up.  I am all for raising the minimum wage, or perhaps even a UBI policy, but I am honestly not sure if either of these would have the desired effect.  The counter-argument that always comes up is that an artificial rise in consumer spending power would just result in a rise in living costs, bringing us back to square one.  Is this true?

What will the impact of increased automation be on the economy?  Will this happen gradually enough for the economy to naturally adjust on its own, or are we going to need social policies to help people who lose jobs or require higher education to stay employed?

 
Again, I am not looking to be shifted away from the left as I fundamentally believe that we should prioritize our concerns for the whole over the radical economic freedom of the individual.  But if it turns out that interventions in capitalism won't fix the problems we want fixed, I would want to shift my focus towards fixing the *psychology* that drives capitalism.  I worry that much of the left's desire for economic redistribution would never be satisfied, would never be *enough*, because it is a reaction to the obsession with material production inherent to capitalism.  We need to distinguish between who suffers *materially* under capitalism, from how we *all* suffer *psychologically* under capitalism.  Maybe there is a limit to redistribution, beyond which our struggle would be to free ourselves from the conflation of identity and productivity, our obsession with luxury as the sign of human value, the ethical compromises we make to maximize profit, etc.  If we can only safely alter the economic system so much, then we should start trying to shift our own subjective relationship *to* the economic system.

TL;DR: there may be practical limits to leftist interventions in capitalism such as minimum wage, UBI, efforts to decrease income disparity and wage stagnation, etc.; we might be better off addressing our value system rather than directly intervening in the economy"	1	
t3_6yqydw	"CMV: When Trump leaves office, the Republican party will be even more extreme than now"	"Currently the Republican party is pretty far right. It seems to have been going in that direction for several years. Trump is probably a natural result of this but I don't think he's the end of that process. I think by the time he leaves office (however that happens), the Republican party (including its voters and media) will be even more extreme than they are currently even if Trump is a complete failure.

Firstly, this has pretty much already happened. When Bush left office, America was heading to a historic economic crash. When Obama left office, America was experiencing higher growth and employment. But currently Republicans believe Obama weakened America and a repeat of Bushs policies (tax cuts, deregulation) will work. Therefore even if America experiences a recession, wider deficit or credit downgrade, Republicans will just ignore the evidence and double down.

There's also evidence that Republicans are moving further right culturally as Breitbart, Jeff Sessions and climate change denial all seem powerful in a party that was once more moderate (e.g. Jeff Sessions was rejected by a republican administration decades ago, a Republican set up the EPA iirc).

Second, they are isolated from objective sources. Afaik, Republicans believe the media is anti-conservative, academia and science are liberal and government agencies (i.e. the 'deep state') oppose them. I think this is partly correct because I believe these groups are mostly committed to research and truth and Republicans are mostly wrong but Republicans dismiss these sources as biased and rely on Fox, Breitbart or religion. This means that Republicans will get more and more extreme as they shut out uncomfortable information and become increasingly radical.

Thirdly, the Republican party seems driven by emotion more than by reason. Democrats moved further right economically in the 90s. Currently the Republicans are led by an extremely natavist president compared to previous Republicans. They seem to react against the times rather than with them. They mostly trust religious sources and traditions due to faith and distrust universities and studies because they dislike what they produce. They also seem driven by a contempt for and fear of democrats rather than the passion for any constructive goal. This makes me think that Trumps success or failure doesn't affect their faith in their beliefs or policies.

I'll CMV if someone can show me convincing proof that the GOP, it's supporters and the media that influences it are capable of adjusting to failures, learning lessons and becoming more moderate.

First off, the claim that the earth has the capacity for more people.

While technically the entire earth's population could fit into an area the size of Texas at moderate density, as people love to point out, this point completely ignores the fact that people like having space, national parks, etc, and pretty much all arguments about how many people the earth could technically house if it was all converted into all housing or food production are kind of useless because nobody wants to be living like that. This would take a massive reduction to our quality of life, and be pretty pointless. [This](https://theconversation.com/7-5-billion-and-counting-how-many-humans-can-the-earth-support-98797) article suggests that the earth could only sustain about 1.5 billion people living at an American standard of living. Given that, it's obvious that the last thing we need is more Americans, but it's fine if people are born elsewhere, right? The issue is that as nations industrialize and people get wealthier they start to demand the American style of living, and so while growth rates in poorer countries may not be an issue to the carrying capacity of the earth, as they start to get richer and richer that population will still be there but will take an increasing toll on the earth, we see this in China already and will see it in India in coming decades, as in China more and more of their massive population has entered the middle class and we see exactly this happening.

Given this, you can see why I think declining birthrates are a good thing, because even if the earth is supporting our current population of 7.5 billion, even with the same population in 20 years we will be needing a lot more land to support those 7.5 billion. People may propose the economic argument that constant growth is important, and while yes it's good in the short term, I don't think it's good for the long term survival of our species. For literally hundreds of thousands of years our species did just fine without constant growth, and yet it will only take a couple thousands years for us to jeopardize all of that with an obsession with expansion. And either way, even if the growth rate declines in the US, it's pretty high in many other parts of the world, and the US will have no problem importing high skilled labor from poor countries, so things will continue to be fine for the US, it's more of a problem for the third world countries that experience brain drain, so there's even less of a practical incentive for the US to try to incentivize their population to grow. So CMV, why is overpopulation not a problem and a declining birthrate a bad thing?

t3_23svx5	CMV: The United States should not drill any oil	"The United State's policy of increasing oil drilling is misguided. In all practicality, it is counter productive. First of all, the environmental consequences of drilling are intense, ranging from devastating the area to pollutants, to causing geologic instability with fracking techniques. Second, increasing oil production is both functionally and ideologically counter to the renewable energy movement. Third, it provides minimal economic benefit to the US. The most common rationale for expansion of drilling is that it will lower oil prices, but that is a misconception. Oil companies will always sell their oil on the world market, at world prices. We cannot force them to sell their oil at lower US specific costs for obvious reasons.
sources and examples will be provided on request.

In order to develop this case further, I offer the following. In the long run, the world will run out of fossil fuels. Honestly, this is a matter of when. This should not be our goal, as a world that is not ready to switch is not a pretty picture. I offer two advantages to stopping US production.

 First, it is not making as large a positive impact than stopping it. See point #3 here http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/23svx5/cmv_the_united_states_should_not_drill_any_oil/ch0aqak

any resulting price increase will create an incentive to innovate in renewable technology.

Second, in a fatalistic world view, we will probably fail at the switch anyways. That means that the price of oil will skyrocket. If everyone else has run dry, we set the price, and become insanely rich. This could give us the resources to make the switch at the last possible second, a hallmark of US politics. That is, if we can keep the wealth in the economy and out of CEO's bank accounts.

t3_dk31s8	CMV: 'The end justifies the means' is a dangerous idea.	"The problems I see with the idea that the end justifies the means are mainly two:

1. The 'end', the actual outcome, cannot usually be predicted accurately. Therefore even if the intention was good, that can't be an excuse for doing evil.

2. If the means are violent then the end will most likely be violent or oppressive. 

I think what people mean when they use this sentence is that IF it leads to something good, a little evil to get there is justified. 

But if 'the means' add to the already existing evil, that will just increase the amount of evil in the world. 

Thinking that this can ever lead to more good seems absurd to me.

In short: if someone claims that the end justifies the means I would want to know why this person believes they know the future.

If the future in a certain case is indeed predictable, I think the end can sometimes justify the means, but that would be extremely rare and special cases."	1	
t3_7gp9ao	CMV: Nuclear Power is the Solution to Our Future Energy Needs	"While the nuclear industry has had a somewhat strange and turbulent trajectory since the emergence of the atomic era, I’m still convinced that nuclear power is the best option to meeting future energy needs. To clarify this position, I will discuss the benefits and address the commonly associated liabilities 

First, nuclear power is a clean, reliable power generation method that yields zero carbon and methane emissions. While some greenhouse gases are inevitably released during mining and construction phases, nuclear power remains a much cleaner alternative in terms of air quality and natural resource preservation when compared to traditional fossil fuel methods. Additionally, the implementation of breeder reactors, which can use more naturally abundant forms of uranium and more efficiently recycle fuel in the power generation process, can make nuclear power essentially a renewable method. With more research and development, nuclear reactors will become more powerful and more efficient, maximizing the power output from fissile material while also cutting back on generated waste. Nuclear reactors also are capable of supplying much more power than solar, wind, or geothermal methods. Plants can also be built anywhere, no matter the climate or earth conditions, unlike solar, wind, and geothermal. 

Many point out issues of security, safety, and waste management. I’ve read about thorium reactors, which seem to address many of these concerns. For one, thorium power can’t be weaponized, which could address proliferation concerns. Additionally, thorium produces less waste, is more naturally abundant than uranium, features more efficient nuclear properties than uranium, and produces waste that is radioactive for a few centuries as opposed to millenia. Thorium reactors seem to be paving the way towards a green nuclear future. In 200 years, I’m confident that if these reactors can be developed into the energy market, they will be able to sustainably support our energy needs.

I could get into more of the specifics of future development into reactors, but we can probably get into that in the comments. Looking forward to hearing what people have to say about this.

t3_72lcma	CMV: Decreasing taxes and regulation won't do much to create more jobs and increase pay.	"This seems to be a tenet of many CEOs and conservatives.  Was watching the CEOs of Citibank and IBM talking about how important this is.  They seemed to be alluding to the fact that if they had tax breaks and less regulation they would be expanding.  But those two companies had net profits of over $2 billion EACH in the 2nd QUARTER.   If $2 billion a quarter isn't enough to spur expansion, how much is enough?  

It isn't just huge companies that are profitable.  The stock market has grown by over 250% in the last 8 years.  Investors have had record profits while worker's pay has remained flat. 

IMO, right now, the investor has so much power companies can't expand.  Expansion is risky. Why mess with record profits?  250% is unsustainable, yet investors pressure companies  to beat last years record profits. 
  
 Increased productivity is the buzz word because it is a big reason companies are so profitable.  Why would additional profits cause companies to pay more and expand (reduce productivity?) It has been very profitable for companies to run lean and mean.

Now I get that there will be some increased employment, but record profits  havn't spurred investment why will adding to that profit change things?  Do we need to give investors 20%, 30% or more in yearly profits, increase the debt and increase pollution in return for a slight bump in wages and employment?

The other side believes that expansion happens when demand increases.  Increasing salary for the many is a much more effective way to increase demand (for a consumer product) than increasing profits for the few, (which should eventually lead to increased profits for the few anyway.)

t3_6ep5m2	CMV: Pulling out of the Paris Climate Treaty is a good move for the USA.	"These posts are always too long to read so I'll try to summarize my argument in order of importance and expand in the comments.

1. The Paris Climate Agreement is absurdly expensive, especially for America.

2. [Some estimates](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1758-5899.12295/full) claim that it may only reduce global temperatures by 0.17°C  in 2100 even if sustained throughout the century.

3. The treaty is setup like a self-evaluation where countries can set their own targets and are not punished for failing to meet them.

4. Our original targets were [far too ambitious for the 2016 Climate Plan](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2016/sep/26/us-climate-change-emissions-miss-2025-target-research).

5.  Countries like China and Russia would actually *receive* money from the treaty and are likely to cheat their way through it anyway.

Lastly, in fear of being called insensitive to the future of our earth, it's not that I don't support action to protect our planet (I love nature), but I don't support expensive government intervention that hurts our poorest citizens most...especially when there is relatively [new science](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2016/carbon-dioxide-fertilization-greening-earth) showing how [""Global Greening""](https://www.thegwpf.org/matt-ridley-global-warming-versus-global-greening/) could help mitigate the effects of future climate change.


The treaty asks that OECD nations give [at least $100 Billion per year to less developed nations by 2020](http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/paris_nov_2015/application/pdf/cop_auv_template_4b_new__1.pdf) to help them meet their goals. Seeing as the US makes up 34% of the GDP from those nations, we'll likely be footing over a third of the bill. That's nearly as much as our federal government [currently spends on the environment ourselves.](https://media.nationalpriorities.org/uploads/discretionary_spending_pie%2C_2015_enacted.png) 

Additionally, the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum published an extremely [in depth study](http://web.stanford.edu/group/emf-research/docs/emf16/CostKyoto) of economic outcomes from variations of the Kyoto Protocol. It estimated that the protocol could cost the US as much as 1.4% of GDP per year ($250 Billion). That's nearly a quarter of our federal discretionary spending--AKA completely unaffordable. We would have to raise taxes by 8% across the board to pay for that (assuming no other changes in spending).

t3_mhxze1	CMV: The United States is grossly under-taxed	"So, I am totally aware that the specifics of tax, fiscal, and monetary policies combine in a myriad of ways. I get that this will necessarily be a simplified argument because the tax code is so complex, and other decisions the government makes could offset various effects.   


But my argument is fairly simple:

1. The average OECD tax revenue was about 34% of GDP in 2018, the US's average in 2018 is about 24%, on par with countries like Chile, Turkey, and Mexico.
2. One of the biggest reasons we do not have adequate spending to address health care, education, and infrastructure is that we are afraid of increasing the deficit. By keeping tax revenues artificially low, we place ourselves in a situation where we feel we can't afford to address these needs. 
3. 2020 demonstrated that we have too low of revenues to adequately address serious national crises. Other OECD nations provided monthly income for those who lost jobs. Canada's 3rd quarter economic recovery was 16 percentage points ahead of the USA's, largely because monthly payments and emergency small business loans stopped businesses from closing. 
4. By having very low taxes on businesses, our tax policy discourages increasing wages. While not a tax-rate argument, as it gets into the specifics of policy, corporate tax rates could be raised and sources of deductions more limited to encourage raising worker wages in order to utilize wages for tax write-off purposes.  Corporate tax rates could even have their tax rates tied to the wages of their lowest quintile wage earners, make profit-sharing a write-off, etc. But it is a tax-revenue issue. 
5. Low-business taxation is producing a tragedy of the commons effect on infrastructure. When large manufacture such as GE pays $0 in corporate income tax, yet utilizes public roads, public ports, public bridge, the public power grid, etc., to support their production capacity, they are causing wear on that infrastructure while contributing nothing to its maintenance. While related to point 2, this is more of a combination of a moral point and a note that the wear on our infrastructure can't help but to increase unless corporate tax revenues increase."	1	
t3_8jnq10	CMV:The ultimate goal of the republican party is to subconsciously and/or consciously initiate the apocalypse in the middle	"I lived in NY my whole, and I've been ""studying"" republicans and how they behave. They view other religions as threats, especially islam because there are over a billion of them, and that scares them. They believe they are in a religious war, and they must win.

This is what Steve Bannon (and to an extent mike pence) have said blatantly in public.

Every issue, guns, climate change etc, is rooted in how they can protect themselves when the apocalypse happens. They WANT it to happen. The iran deal tried to prevent iran from getting nukes. Repubs will never admit why they are against it, but they want iran to make nukes. They want to create as much chaos as possible in the middle so that a nuke goes off. They also only seem to support israel because they want jews to protect jesus when he comes back.

I don't believe trump or even most democrats believe in this, but they would be ok with it. They won't admit that they are provoking or pushing us down this path, but they want it to happen whether its conscious or subconscious. It truly frightens me. 

Also, why do you think repubs are so against the idea of climate change? They hate the idea of everyone fighting a common enemy. Under the climate change threat, all religions and peoples would have to unite to fight it. They hate that. They want a religious war and to be on top. They don't want a prosperous middle east. 

I desperately want to be proven wrong. Again, I know that trump doesn't believe this, but it doesn't matter because he's a tool for those religious evangelicals and he wouldn't care if it actually happened.

t3_7nqyg2	"CMV: Humanity will not make any significantly successful push towards colonizing space, the moon or mars in the next 100 years"	"A mars colony will need constant support from earth over a few decades. But by the 2050s the world will be in a great struggle against climate change and mass unemployment from automation. So great will be the struggle that mars colonization will take a backseat.

Its like packing up for a vacation to death valley while your house fills with smoke from a kitchen fire.

It will be like trying to put your eggs in more than one basket, but your current basket is rotting from the bottom and the other basket is riddled with holes.

It's like a farmer deciding between tending to their failing crops or moving to a desert island.

Climate change is a larger problem than people think. It will bring more social unrest (and more war spending), more homelessness (as more people are displaced), and threaten our food security. It will bring more/worse droughts, more/worse floods, more/worse wildfires and more/worse hurricanes.

Such stressors lead to more war mongering, more xenophobia, more demagoguery (like trump), more strain on our disaster relief and insurance budgets.

Add to that, an automation crisis that is left unchecked might very well cost governments a great deal in either preventing or managing unrest.

With all of these things occupying us it seems unlikely that we will have the political will to support a large mars colony. A single manned mars mission might provide a lovely distraction for the suffering serfs, but it is truly doubtful that the world will accept the continuous cost of a permanent colony.

t3_l20m2t	CMV: Boomers are the worst generation and until we stop catering to them with our government policies our society will not get better	"Almost everything wrong with our current society can be blamed on boomers, the housing prices, low wages, horrible job market, offshoring to China, global warming, allowing companies to violate privacy rights and roll back our other rights everything was done on the boomers watch and most of it was for their benefit and future generations detriment. 

I'm struggling to think of a major flaw in our society that can't be traced back to boomers, all these policies were done specifically for their benefit at the cost of future generations. If you look at trends on how people are doing globally things are getting better but in western countries like Canada, US, Australia ect. it's all getting worse, I believe suicides especially of young people is the greatest indicator of that. Unless we stop catering to boomers or more likely until they simply all die off of old age our societies will continue to deteriorate.

t3_4kkh79	CMV: The entire world should become vegan	"As far as I can tell, the benefits of everyone in the world abstaining from the consumption of meat, fish, milk and eggs would have these benefits:

* Cut down dramatically on greenhouse gas emissions
* Slow down the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens 
* Provide more usable space for crops and housing
* Halt deforestation 
* Preseve populations of ocean life as well as cut down on the damage caused by large fishing vessels
* Lower incidents of heart disease (the world's leading cause of death) as well as obesity and other health issues
* Minimize the suffering of animals 

Meanwhile, the main downside to the elimination of these industries would be the elimination of related jobs.  I don't take that lightly.  Some of those jobs would shift as the shift in agriculture did, but not all of them.  [This](http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/feed_the_world/2014/05/meat_eating_and_climate_change_vegetarians_impact_on_the_economy_antibiotics.html) article in Slate argues that this issue would be enough to destroy the world economy, but that's only if the world goes vegan all at exactly the same time, which is impossible.  Instead, a gradual reduction in the consumption of animals and their by-products over the course of a few years would give the economy room to adjust.  And, yeah, even with that, some people's lives would be terrible without their job in the meat industry.  

But it's not an industry that treats its impoverished workers much better than livestock to begin with.  Furthermore, if we continue down the path we're on, with a rising demand for meat, eventually, everyone's lives will be terrible.  As it stands now, we're already witnessing the devastation of global warming, the death of the oceans, deforestation, lack of health care for the poor (in the US) and so on.  The rich will be able to afford treatments for stronger bacteria (as well as obesity), land for homes, and all the other niceties, for a time, but eventually these problems will reach them as well. 

For the sake of argument I'm only talking about practices that result in the killing of animals, so products like wool and fertilizer would still exist in this scenario.

t3_4eiao4	CMV: War should be abolished.	"I am a strong pacifist and I believe that war should be ended on a global level, once and for all. Human beings should be learning to live together as one united world instead of fractured nations that are perpetually in conflict with each other. Although it may be a lofty goal, in principle world peace is something that everyone should be working towards. 

Simply because war seems common and part of human behavior, doesn't justify the ethics of war. There should be no circumstance under which war is permissible, because it goes against the principle of working towards global peace. Every step made towards global peace is undone when we allow war to take place.

The human species is ultimately one, so the act of war is self-destructive to our survival and integrity as a species. It goes against human nature to destroy each other. Human beings have always relied on their social networks and group cooperation to survive, so the same perspective should be applied on a global level. 

It is illegal and unjust to commit murder, so it should be equally illegal and abhorrent to commit mass-murder on a multi-national level, but for some reason our ethical bodies have a form of cognitive dissonance that deems mass murder permissible. Just as it is immoral to act violently towards another human being and enact bodily injury upon another human being, we should apply these same principles in the act of war. We must apply our ethics universally and not just within our borders. This also ties in with the idea of non-violence. We should uphold to the ethical standard of not committing acts of violence against other human beings when this is on a micro level, and even more so when this is on a macro level.

The idea that War should be abolished is also supported by the fact that many countries have stockpiles of nuclear warheads, so if there were to be a World War 3, we would see mass destruction on an unprecedented level. Not only would vast swaths of the human population be annihilated, there would be catastrophic environmental damage done to the earth. Not only would humanity be destroying itself, but we would be destroying the ecosystem as well. We would be destroying life as we know it – and potentially the only life in the universe. 

Due to the increase in our technological ability to destroy life, we have a duty to preserve not only humanity but life itself. And due to the constant evolution and destructive capabilities of our war machines, the future of war can only become more and more catastrophic. So the more humanity evolves and develops, the more imperative it is to prevent war from occurring. Therefore, the best time to stop war is now. 

War is ultimately an unsustainable practice that must be put to an end immediately. This means that we should oppose any government sanction to go to war, and it should not be illegal for a person to choose not to participate in war. In this case, our ethical responsibility to the human race and to the Earth should be held above duty to nation and country.

t3_20er8m	I believe that it is not morally obligatory to be a vegetarian. CMV.	"In my view, there is no reason why a rational, responsible person has to be a vegetarian. I am not saying that vegetarianism has no benefits, but only that these benefits do not obligate a reasonable person to become a vegetarian.

The burden of proof for the claim that we are morally obligated to be vegetarians falls on the vegetarian who thinks that we have this obligation. This is because there should be a good reason behind a moral obligation (moral obligations shouldn't be arbitrary) and because the vegetarian is suggesting a change to the way that most people currently live. Therefore, it makes sense to investigate this issue by asking what reasons vegetarians can give for saying that there is a moral obligation to be a vegetarian. 

I will consider the reasons given by the vegetarian philosopher William O. Stephens in his paper [""Five Arguments for Vegetarianism.""](http://puffin.creighton.edu/phil/stephens/fiveargumentsforvegetarianism.htm) The failure of the arguments in this paper will establish a prima facie case that respondents will need to overturn by presenting fresh reasons why vegetarianism is morally obligatory or overturning my objections to Stephens' arguments.

**First Argument: The Argument from Distributive Justice**

According to this argument, meat is produced in a way that wastes a lot of grain; for example, producing one pound of beef apparently requires 16 to 21 pounds of grain and soy. That grain would be better spent by sending it to poorer nations to feed the hungry. Therefore, we have a moral obligation to be vegetarians.

First of all, this argument assumes that we are morally obligated to help the hungry in other countries. I agree that helping poor people can be a nice thing to do, but as an egoist and follower of Ayn Rand's ethics, I do not believe that we have a moral obligation to engage in that kind of charity. So at most, this argument establishes that it would be nice to help the poor by giving up meat, not that we have a moral obligation to help the poor by giving up meat.

Second, the problem is not so much that we're not producing enough food as that we are having trouble distributing the food. [This source](http://12.000.scripts.mit.edu/mission2014/problems/inadequate-food-distribution-systems) explains some of the problems involved in feeding the hungry: ""Enough food is produced worldwide to feed all the people in the world (Leathers, p. 133).  However, despite this alarming truth, nearly 1 billion people are suffering from chronic hunger today. There are a wide range of factors that contribute to this problem, but perhaps one of the most significant is poor food distribution.""

**Second Argument: The Argument from Environmental Harm**

According to this argument, farming meat causes various forms of environmental harm, such as that produced by the greenhouse gases given off by the process of farming cattle.

This argument assumes that a person should act based on the well being of the environment, rather than their own self interest. It is possible that farming cattle and other practices that produce greenhouse gases will lead to global warming, but the effects of global warming will occur far enough in the future that most people alive today will not be affected.

Furthermore, farming cattle is not the major source of greenhouse gas emissions. The study ""Dietary choices and greenhouse gas emissions - assessment of impact of vegetarian and organic options at national scale"" by Helmi Risku-Norja, Sirpa Kurppa and Juha Helenius ([link](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/228790125_Dietary_choices_and_greenhouse_gas_emissionsassessment_of_impact_of_vegetarian_and_organic_options_at_national_scale/file/79e4150f987f15f16f.pdf)) concluded as follows:


extent of the necessary changes. Instead of stressing the impact of individual citizens’ food choices, more attention should be paid to designing effective policy instruments and to social learning.

So everyone becoming vegetarian isn't a good solution to global warming, since it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 7%. The major source of greenhouse gas emissions is soil, which is used by virtually all forms of farming.

**Third Argument: The Feminist Argument from Sexual Politics**

This argument lists 16 examples of cases in which meat eating is associated with masculinity, then concludes that we should stop eating meat in order to undermine the patriarchy that dominates our society.

I think there probably is some kind of link between meat eating and masculinity, but I'm not convinced that the patriarchy would be particularly undermined by people refusing to eat meat. I think there are probably more important reforms to worry about before we go adjusting our dietary choices to make sure they don't have subconscious patriarchal associations.

**Fourth Argument: The Argument from Moral Consideration for Animals**

Stephens presents two examples of arguments from moral consideration for animals. The first, by Peter Singer, argues that since all sentient beings deserve equal moral consideration, and animals obviously have more at stake in not being slaughtered than humans have at stake in not being able to eat animals, we should not eat meat. The second, by Tom Regan, argues that all experiencing subjects of a life have equal inherent value, but farming animals and eating them does not treat them as having inherent value equal to ours, so we should not eat meat.

I don't think either of these arguments create an obligation to be a vegetarian because I am an egoist. I acknowledge that we should not be unnecessarily cruel to animals, but this is because being cruel to animals would make us more brutal toward each other. 

Basically, the question is whether animals have rights, and more broadly, what the source of rights is. There is no intrinsic obligation to give equal rights to all sentient beings, on my view, but only to sentient beings who are capable of reasoning. Sentient beings who are capable of reasoning need rights because they can be deterred from producing new inventions and innovations if they see that they can be stripped of the profits from those inventions and innovations by others. So human beings need to be given rights for egoistic reasons, but animals do not.

**Fifth Argument: The Prudential Argument from Health**

This argument asserts that it is a lot healthier to be a vegetarian for a variety of reasons including the fact that some cultures which primarily eat vegetables have long life expectancies and the fact that the strength and stamina of vegetarians has been shown to be greater than that of meat eaters in studies.

This is probably the best argument for vegetarianism by the standard of egoism. I will agree that vegetarianism probably has some health benefits, but I don't think that this creates an obligation to be a vegetarian because it is possible to get those health benefits while still eating some meat. Eating meat might even be better, since omega-3 fatty acids can be gotten more easily by eating fish than by eating vegetables. Also, a lot of people think meat tastes better than vegetables, which might provide some reason to eat meat even if vegetarianism is agreed to be strictly healthier.

I conclude that there is no moral obligation to be a vegetarian. Thanks for reading."	1	
t3_b3qi0r	CMV: Processed clean water is not a human right	"I was recently reading about Nestle's horrible practices, and stumbled upon this:

[https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nestle-ceo-water-not-human-right/](https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/nestle-ceo-water-not-human-right/)

&#x200B;

Here's what I think:

1. Someone has to filter/clean the water found in nature so that we can consume it safely without risking illness.
2. We cannot just trust ""unowned"" water for consumption, we need some guarantee the water is safe, hence someone or some group has to do work to ensure this standard.
3. Therefore, the water has to be controlled by this hypothetical overseer to keep it free of outside sources of contamination (example: Someone pollutes a river on purpose)
4. It is foolish to think there should be no compensation for this, people have to devote their time and effort
5. I think calling access to clean water a human right is noble, but practically fruitless unless enforced, and doing so takes an enormous amount of coordination and effort. 
6. Where do we draw the line? Do I have the right to clean water in the middle of nowhere? Should someone who cannot afford water be given free water? (I believe so but this only shifts the burden of payment on someone else)

I'm seriously thinking of isolating myself from this rotten society, living on welfare as long as I can and commit suicide if/when the money runs out. I'm not going to work 10 hours a day like a slave to enrich the same people who gave me this lousy world.

t3_1uuuef	"I believe that if you are not an expert in a field, you should form your beliefs based on the consensus and common beliefs of experts in that field. This applies to global warming, GMOs, and even social ideas like institutional oppression, patriarchy and privilege. CMV."	"This seems like a pretty agreeable belief, but I will be applying it to a few things. 

Since experts dedicate years of their lives to understanding and researching topics within a field, it's a type of hubris to think that we can form oppositionary viewpoints that contradict scientific consensus.

People who deny human's role in climate change are contradicting the [overwhelming scientific consensus](http://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus) that agree that climate trends can be attributed to anthropogenic activities. 

People who believe vaccines cause autism, cancer, etc, are foolishly contradicting the science and the major medical organizations that agree that there is no such link.

People who believe genetically modified foods are unhealthy or dangerous are similarly going against the broad scientific consensus regarding the safety of current GMOs.

My final point, which I suspect will be most controversial, simply applies the previous logic that I have used, but in the context of sociological fields.

The majority of sociologists agree that 'white privilege' exists ([1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_privilege#cite_note-20)). Furthermore, ideas of patriarchy and systematic oppression are the theoretical bread and butter of sociological thinking. 

The fact that there is no scholarly support for movements and ideas purported by the men's rights movements is akin to the lack of valid peer-reviewed evidence by people opposing human influenced climate change, vaccines, or GMOs.

CMV why people should either not form their opinions based on scientific consensus, or why scientific consensus in sociological fields should be dismissed or ignored."	1	
t3_6jwxux	CMV: The Republican Party today is an evil institution and voting for or supporting Republican politicians is inherently immoral	"I believe that, although it's possible that some of their positions and policies are well intentioned and may lead to overall good for American society, overall the actions of the Republican party in 2017 is overall evil and immoral. Thus, supporting this organization in any meaningful way (such as voting for a member of the party), regardless of your reasons, is an immoral action since doing so either equates to supporting these actions and positions or willfully ignoring them.

The Republican Party actively supports a number of immoral policies, such as:

1) Removing or restricting rights from LGBTQ people

2) Restricting voting access for minorities

3) Taking away health care from millions to redistribute that money to the wealthy

4) Supporting sexual assault by the president

5) Supporting the mocking of the disabled by the president

6) Supporting the death penalty, which kills innocent people

7) Lying about climate change which may harm millions

8) Actively worsening climate change due to energy policies

9) Damaging public education in favor of private education

10) Supporting the gun industry which is responsible for the needless deaths of thousands

I could go on, and some of these are more ""evil"" than others, but overall this is an organization whose mission is largely to hurt a majority of Americans in favor of slightly improving the lives of a small few.

This all isn't to say that the Democratic Party is the opposite or ""good"" - I could see myself also being convinced that they are also overall evil (I currently don't hold that stance), but this post is simply speaking about the role of the Republican Party in society and the moral implications of either directly or indirectly supporting what I see as an evil institution formed by evil men and women.

Overall, I'll say that although my general overall opinion on Republicans hasn't drastically changed, I see that I've used way too broad terms and have not well defined things, and from that perspective I need to go back to the drawing board and really think about what specifically I consider ""evil"" or ""immoral"" versus what are policies that reasonable people can disagree on. My list of examples in hindsight was too simplistic and is really just a vague list of positions and actions that I strongly disagree with that I just came up with off the top of my head.  I still think that there are some actions and policies that have true malice in their intent that are sold with lies and have no significant public good, but these should be better defined and more scoped towards individuals who vote for or support these. I'm also still trying to reconcile if it's ""immoral"" to vote for or support, say, an unrepentant sexual predator, but that to be fair is not a Republican issue - that's an issue that happens to be associated with a current prominent Republican. 

So, the short answer is that I'll officially mark my view as being changed after this discussion. I may think more about these issues and refine the scope of my thoughts, but vague positions that I've laid out don't really hold up after reading the many responses here. ∆

t3_8iztyq	CMV: Presidents Obama and Trump were both right on Iran.	"President Obama needed to make a deal with Iran to keep them from having nucleur weapons, and the negotiators worked out the best deal possible. It was clearly not a permanent solution. He did the best we could've done at the time with what leverage we had. 

President Trump is also making the correct move: it is time to revisit Iran. We won't suffer economically by adding sanctions, DPRK won't denuclearize while Iran gets a sweetheart deal, and Iran needs to be dealt with and punished for their excessive meddling in the region. Our allies SA and Isreal both support our actions for obvious reasons. 

The EU, also an ally, does not, since they are more dependent economically on Iran and don't want to go through the reimposition of sanctions. They are simply arguing out of self interest and political reasons, but they cannot rationally conclude that the current JCPOA is going to be a solution for much longer - so they let the US take the lead on renegotiations.

Also, everyone remembers what happened to Gaddafi. It's not a self serving move to completely and totally relinquish nuclear weapons once they are developed, so we should not expect any leader to do so without a very strong carrot and stick presentation.

Change my view!

t3_jzbh73	"CMV: The GOP, in the past decade, has stopped fighting for actual policy change and instead has turned into very little more than an opposition party."	"Let's start this by a disclaimer: I'm a liberal-leaning independent who really hates both parties. But, I've noticed that the republican party has changed since Obama to a party that just bases any new policy or belief on solely opposing the democrat party. The main reasons I have for this belief are that the only solid policy for the GOP comes out of the 20th century or before, the party is riddled with conspiracy theories that attack and slander democrats, trump has abandoned many conservative policies and has received little to no criticism for it and that their only modern policy seems to be saying that they won't do what democrats do instead of proposing a different avenue.

So first off, the only policy that Republicans actually have comes out of the 20th century: lower taxes, pro-life don't take away our guns, personal liberty, states' rights. But the world is changing, and every new issue that voters care about is simply denied by Republicans rather than the party suggesting alternative policy. Take climate change for example: instead of proposing alternative policy, the status quo in Republicans is to claim that it doesn't even exist in the first place. Racial inequality as well - instead of proposing policy, they spend all their time nitpicking that the country isn't ""systemically"" racist and calling BLM members communists so they don't actually have to face the problem. Similar things have happened with healthcare costs and drug reform. Some Republicans have proposed policy for these things, but they're known as mavericks who have broken from their party (John Kasich, John McCain, Mitt Romney).

Second, the right is riddled with conspiracies specifically accusing democrats wildly of random stuff. Like, it's not enough that they want to raise taxes, but they also need to be an elite gang of pedophiles who run child sex rings in the basements of pizza shops or put microchips made by deep state operatives like Gates and Soros in items that help save lives to control our minds. And these are barely even fringe conspiracies anymore. A very decent percentage of Republicans believe some or part of both of these. This means to me that they just want to demonize Democrats and fear monger more than propose policy.

Speaking of conspiracy theorists, Trump has shown that the GOP is ready and willing to abandon classic policy like limiting the power of the presidency, being respectful and ""presidential"", being a man of family and faith, and lowering the deficit. Not only that, but he has some of the strongest and most fervent support among Republicans I've seen in a while. I can only assume that his intense support among Republicans is extremely tied to the corresponding detest by the democrat policy.

Lastly, a lot of republican ""policy"" has turned into ONLY attacking democrat policy and calling it socialist or communist, then offering no alternative solution to problems that are still very much real. For example, everyone can agree that healthcare costs are far too high. But the only thing close to a solution by Republicans is uniting behind what they WONT do, not what they will do. And those things they won't do are in direct opposition to democratic policies. This also connects to climate change, student debt (to a lesser degree), racism, education reform, police reform, and prison reform (to a lesser degree)."	1	
t3_55jcu4	"CMV: I shouldn’t vote for Trump even though he’d save me in excess of $2,500,000"	"After Trump’s proposed tax brackets and estate tax repeal, I would initiate transactions that would save me (and direct family members), at minimum, USD$2.5m.

For argument’s sake, I’ll be the rich person who cares about nothing but his own bottom line. I don’t care about accessible abortion. If my daughter needs one, I’ll fly her to Europe. I don’t care about the environment; my Tesla has “bioweapon” air filters. I don’t care about civil rights or gun nuts; I have bodyguards to protect me from inequality-driven rioting.

Let’s say all those above and this fair and just society nonsense don’t add up to $2.5m for me. Aren’t Republicans still bad for the economy overall? The market doesn’t do as well under them. You can say it’s mostly luck, but the frivolous wars Bush started that destroyed so much value were definitely rooted in Republican thinking—not something a Democrat would do. Voodoo economics is known to be fiction, so any maneuvers in that direction will, by definition, have unintended consequences.

To me, it just doesn’t seem worth it. I can save $2.5m off the bat, but under average market growth, I can make that back in a couple of years of Clinton or Obama at the helm. A few missteps by someone like Trump: one pointless war, botched trade deals that sour the dollar, or any of a dozen things he plans that can go wrong, and all that saved on taxes is wiped away.

We know reasonable presidents following Keynesianism get us about 10% a year. What am I missing that’s making most people in my situation vote Trump? Do they think, in addition to the tax savings, he’s going to do better than 10%? I’m pretty conservative in my investment strategy, so I’d rather have a guaranteed 10% than a risk of 20% or -10%. Are others hoping for a huge gain? Do they really think the unstable market he’ll bring won’t negate any tax savings he directly offers?

t3_ppp1gq	CMV: Rich people are inherently kind of villainous	" 

Okay, I know that sounds pretty inflammatory. I don’t believe that all rich people are terrible, but I do think that a willingness to embrace being significantly wealthy does demonstrate a willingness to accept the poverty and suffering of those around you. Which also results in the rich often feeling they’ve somehow earned their status and that everyone else isn’t as smart or as skilled as they are. It’s very hard for me to figure out how that perspective and lifestyle can be morally justified. Unless you subscribe to a very individualistic and solipsistic moral philosophy….Which honestly seems like a pretty sociopathic way to look at things.

I’ve read multiple articles (I didn’t cite them because it takes 5 seconds to do a search and find dozens of scholarly articles supporting this) indicating that being rich makes people more self absorbed and less compassionate towards those around them. All my personal experiences in life have definitely supported this outlook and those statistics. I have family members, friends, and colleagues in every economic bracket, ranging from multimillionaires to people barely able to make rent in their trailer park. Without a doubt, those in poverty have been dramatically more charitable and willing to lend a hand or even some cash if they were able, while almost none of the wealthier people I know could be described as particularly charitable. Obviously plenty of wealthy people are involved in charity work, but rarely or never in a way that could be described as sharing a significant portion of their wealth. Donations seem to be more about tax write offs, PR, or an amount that might seem impressive but is insignificant when compared to their overall wealth. Growing up, the advice I received from the richer people I knew was to not give money to the homeless because they'll probably use it to buy drugs and you’re enabling their bad habit. This was not a one time occurrence, it literally happened half a dozen times. I also know several wealthy people who said that they voted for Trump because they assumed it would benefit them more financially, and had no regard for the social, political, or environmental implications. 

I’ve really questioned whether or not this perspective is just some form of prejudice on my part. I did grow up very poor and that experience didn’t make me envy the rich as much as it led me to view them as sheltered, privileged, and usually indifferent to the suffering of others. I think the wealthy justify this outlook through some kind of “merit” based perspective, which is an understandably desirable conclusion for someone in that position to believe, but is also completely absurd when you account for the impact of personal privilege and socio-political realities. 

I think I’m a pretty open minded and a reasonably educated person, and it's just hard to believe that I’m wrong about this. Basically every major problem the world faces can be traced to the actions of the rich and powerful seeking to increase their wealth and consolidate their power. I mean, a handful of Exxon executives are basically responsible for killing the environment on a global scale. They had the potential to spearhead a drive towards renewable energy following their discovery of CO2's impact on the earth’s climate in the 1970's, and instead chose to begin a misinformation campaign in order to continue business as usual and ensure a stable increase in wealth (hooray growth capitalism). 

When I was younger I used to think the expression “Greed is the root of all evil” was  a bit ridiculous. It seemed like there were much worse things. But now, it's hard not to feel like it's one of the truest things I’ve ever heard. So yeah, CMV."	1	
t3_ae04qj	CMV: Tucker Carlson is wrong about Cannabis	"Apparently Tucker when off on a long monologue and among cable news junkies it was a shot heard 'round the world. Surprisingly, on the list of the ills of our nation (the USA) is legal Cannabis. This is a bit of what he had to say: 

 ""If you really loved your fellow Americans, as our leaders should, if it would break your heart to see them high all the time. Which they are. A huge number of our kids, especially our boys, are smoking weed constantly. You may not realize that, because new technology has made it odorless. But it’s everywhere.

 Once our leaders understood they could get rich from marijuana, marijuana became ubiquitous. In many places, tax-hungry politicians have legalized or decriminalized it. Former Speaker of the House John Boehner now lobbies for the marijuana industry. His fellow Republicans seem fine with that. “Oh, but it’s better for you than alcohol,” they tell us. 

 Who cares? Talk about missing the point. Try having dinner with a 19-year-old who’s been smoking weed. The life is gone. Passive, flat, trapped in their own heads. Do you want that for your kids? Of course not. Then why are our leaders pushing it on us? You know the reason. ""

I think having dinner with most 19 year olds is awful anyway, I almost wish they would smoke weed so I don't have to listen to their idiotic ideas on the world. I really doubt the reason Cannabis is legal is because John Boehner might get more money. I also doubt that kids are smoking weed constantly, in fact, it seems rather stable. 

By all means though, I might be off base, change my view.

We are beginning to seek colonization of other planets, primarily because we fear that Earth may soon be inhospitable. Realistically, we will carry the same habits to other planets and perpetuate the exploitation of native habitat and lifeforms. 

Our intelligence means we have heightened capacity for suffering. While it's true that we also have a great ability for happiness, can we justify the joy of some for the profound suffering of innocent others? We no longer follow ethics of nature.

t3_52rnat	CMV: Gary Johnson not knowing what Aleppo is disqualifies him from being President in my mind.	"I have three primary reasons for this:

The leader of the free world should not be ignorant.  I respect his stance of non-interventionism.  A lot of troubles happening around the world are due to American meddling.  It'll take a strong, principled man not to intervene in genocides, dictators slaughtering their own people, and the subsequent international condemnation for not acting.  However, ignorance is inexcusable.  If you're condemning 300,000 civilians to die of starvation in Aleppo through your inaction, I want you to understand the gravity of the decision.  Principled non-interventionism is a stance, being an idiot running for the White House is not.  (Also, the siege of Aleppo might be relieved if the ceasefire holds and aid can make it past government troops.  I doubt Gary Johnson knows that fact before the Aleppo fiasco.) 

Secondly, the President should be aware of current events.  Aleppo was making the headlines especially that week. as the situation there worsened.  If Gary Johnson blanked on that question, then he has not been paying attention to the news for 5 minutes or his staffers have not.  A president needs to maintain awareness of both the greatest global threats to America and the greatest global crises at all times.  I hope it's not too difficult to ask Gary Johnson to watch the news or be informed by his staffers.

Thirdly, since the President acts as the face of the Government to both its people and to nations abroad, a President needs to act ""presidential"" and project confidence and respect at all times.  Even if the first two reasons were excusable for some reason, there are much softer ways of asking for clarification rather than ""What is Aleppo?"".  Either he is not mentally 100% when he needs to be at an interview, or he just plain lacks personal charisma.  I wished I lived in a world where it didn't matter how you say things and people don't judge you for your flubs, but unfortunately we live in the real world and a world where the President has to interact with world leaders, other human beings, and the media.  Gary is running for the most difficult job in the world, and Gary if elected will have to project strength and confidence for the duration of his Presidency.

For the above reasons, I currently lump Gary Johnson into the same category as Donald Trump and Jill Stein as another incompetent running for the White House.  I created this post on CMV to see if I am missing anything or are the any arguments that would uncategorize him as ""ignorant and incompetent"".

Also, on a slightly related note, I am disgusted with many Redditors attempting to excuse Gary's ignorance with their own.  Reddit mocks the creationists, anti-climate change, and anti-vaccines on a constant basis.  But excusing the pivotal battlefield of Syria?  My mind boggles.  Educated electorate, they are not.

So please, attempt to change my mind.

t3_24g0m7	CMV: I think it makes no difference if I become a vegetarian.

If a many people stop eating meat, then of course damage to the industry can be caused, but it just doesn't matter if a certain individual (For example, me) stops eating meat or not. Simply stopping eating the meat will do virtually nothing.
On the other hand if I dedicate my life for this cause, and try to convert a lot of people, and do lecturers in public etc... Then yes I can make a real difference, but, again, just jumping on the band wagon doesn't do much of anything...

t3_c2ynss	CMV: Biden had the best chance of winning and if the best Dem running	"(I posted this Ryder before I went to sleep at like 4am so it was removed reposting this)

now first and foremost I'd like to consider myself a right-leaning moderate meaning while I tend to agree more with Republican values I also agree on some democratic values which is why I wouldn't fully classify myself as a Republican.

The reason I say this is for a few key reasons. 1 his approach to climate change is much more realistic than some other approaches. unlike Trump who says there's clean call and doesn't seem time with burning coal and unlike Alexandria ocasio-cortez who thinks that by 2050 (I think that was the year but I might be wrong) we will be able to 100% run on renewable energy fight and seems to be more realistic and focus on nuclear energy and other forms of energy that will produce CO2 produce less CO2 that Coal. I agree with this approach because it's a much more realistic way of slowly getting off the reliance on coal

I agree with some of his foreign policy like war with Iran would be a complete f****** disaster. 

I agree with some the social issues like keeping the death penalty. 

I don't pretend to be a master of everything this guy has supported and not I mostly want on to Wikipedia so I might be wrong about some of this stuff but I think he is the best damn running any has the highest chance of winning. I think he has the best chance of winning because he is more moderate than say Bernie Sanders and has a higher chance of appealing to more moderate Americans.

t3_8zxkxc	CMV: A diet can include meat and be as environmentally friendly as a vegan diet.	"I'm not arguing the average meat diet has the same carbon footprint as the average vegan diet. What I'm arguing is that you can easily include meat in your diet and remain within the carbon footprint of the average vegan diet. 

Examples: chicken has the same carbon footprint as rice

Mussels have the same carbon footprint as tofu

Hunted meat, especially in countries which have overpopulation of some species (eg deer, boar etc) not only has an extremely small carbon footprint, but by removing these animals you are actually helping the environment and boosting biodiversity.

There's a secondary argument about the destruction of land for animal farms, which by nature takes more room than growing crops. The counter to which is that fish and mussel farms take up even less space, and when located correctly do not have negative impacts on the environment. Hunting of course doesn't negatively affect the environment when done sustainably, but this isn't a global solution obviously.

t3_fhme5g	CMV: The vegetarian diet is the best diet to follow for optimal health	"I have been a vegetarian for almost 3 years now and I feel healthier and more energized than I was prior to being a vegetarian. I am a vegetarian that eats significant amounts of vegetables with each meal during the day so I am always fueling my body with nutrients. I know that some vegetarians do not eat meat but also do not eat significant amounts of vegetables which might not be as practical for optimal health but I believe that most people who are vegetarians do include a good amount of vegetables into their daily eating habits. 

There are many researched health benefits of a vegetarian diet. There is evidence that a vegetarian diet can lower the risk of cardiac events, risk of cancer, and risk of type 2 diabetes. 

With the rise of information about the negative health effects of meat products due to feedlot factory farming of animals, it seems even more beneficial to be eating a vegetarian diet so that be body does not have to fight the intake of meat raised on GMO grain feed with added antibiotics, hormones and potential for other bacterias and viruses. 

I think that the vegetarian lifestyle, if done adequately, can fuel the body just as a lifestyle that includes meat products. However, I am open to hearing other opinions on this matter.

t3_8j024a	"CMV: The global environment is politically more important than the global economy, and ought be treated as such."	"Humans rely on clean air, water, and food. These resources are produced by Earth's natural environment. Before sophisticated economies and societies emerged, humans collected these resources without third-party cost or quality assurance. 

My view stands on something that is patently obvious, yet somehow lost: If the entire economy were to somehow disappear entirely and currencies lost all value, the human and biological ramifications would be less if the same were true for any ONE of the three needs listed above. 

Thus, if you can somehow demonstrate that the need for water, air, and food somehow succeeds the formation of any type of economy, my view will be changed. (Do not even try)

However, the degree to which each subject (environment versus economy) is valued politically does not reflect this patently obvious fact. If you can provide a compelling case as to why this is, I will also change my view from strong environmentalism. However, I believe that by every political, environmental, and economic measure, humans rely more on the environment than the economy. 

Further, I would consider any argument involving any specific law or regulation pertaining to any economy/environment as fair game.

t3_bj4hyj	"CMV: For economic, moral, environmental and health reasons, almost all of us should aim to go vegan"	"The reason I say most of us is that I want to exclude those who live in food deserts and don’t have other options. For most of us this is not an issue and veganism can easily be achieved.

Economy:

[More than half of Scottish farms would have worked at a loss last year without subsidies](https://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/fp/business/farming/1709568/more-than-half-of-farms-at-loss-without-subsidy/amp/)

The industry is not self-sustaining, and is reliant on subsidies to function at this level. It is estimated that a Big Mac would cost $11 in America if you didn’t take meat subsidies into account. Going vegan means we can eat healthier as well as have more money to invest in different sectors.

As I believe that animal products lead to a variety of diseases, going vegan would result in less hospital visits, surgeries and medication. These things cost us billions every year and can a lot of the time be avoided if we’re careful with what we’re consuming. 

Poor countries are selling their crops as feed for the livestock that is to be consumed by the rich. If we all went vegan, [we’d already have enough plant-based food for the global population](https://www.elementascience.org/article/10.1525/elementa.310/)

Also, see [Michael Gove’s aim to alter agricultural subsidies](https://www.politico.eu/article/uk-presents-post-brexit-plans-for-agriculture/amp/)

Environment:

The transportation of feed from country to country contributes massively to food miles and that isn’t even the final product. Although buying fruit from foreign countries isn’t eco-friendly, it doesn’t hold a candle to the environmental impact of meat.

The water use and emissions for meat, dairy and eggs are [common knowledge](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/science-environment-46459714). The animal agriculture industry is worse than the transportation industry for emissions, and while beef is evidently the main culprit, it is definitely not alone.

Morality:
Every single industry that uses animal products inflict pain on to the animals they are using. [the gassing of pigs](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2942309/amp/Disturbing-footage-pigs-struggling-breathe-killed-CO2-stunning-method-used-supermarket-abattoirs.html), [calves are boltgunned in the head as a result of their gender not being economically beneficial for the dairy industry,](https://youtu.be/_OHk94BebbY) and [chicks are macerated for the same reason](https://youtu.be/xPbeh67VVnk). This happens with free range animals, this happens in your country and even your local farm likely sends animals to the same slaughterhouse as the factories. Besides these particular atrocities, the idea of a miracle farm (which would not be economically viable) still uses animals as products. There is still pain, they are still stripped of their rights. Whether the farmer loves them or not is irrelevant, as what they do to them does not reflect love. I am not personally bashing farmers as the vast majority of them do not have the luxury of changing career paths at the drop of a hat.

Health:
Antibiotics, faeces, pus, blood, mercury, microplastics, high amounts of sodium, cholesterol. Any animal product will have at least one of those in them and they all have negative health consequences (I can’t say this for the pus and blood as I have no data, but I think the fact that it is pus and blood is enough for me to avoid it).

Milk has casein, which when digested creates casomorphin. This is an opioid that makes all mammals crave/be addicted to their mother’s milk so they return. When we drink milk and cheese, we feed a literal addiction. 

We do not have the same length small intestine as obligate carnivores and therefore cannot adequately process it. It can therefore putrify and result in [colorectal cancer](https://www.wcrf.org/int/blog/articles/2015/10/red-meat-and-bowel-cancer-risk-how-strong-evidence)

The Dieticians Association of Australia: “With good planning, you can get all of the nutrients you need from a vegan diet to be healthy.”

There is nothing naturally found in animal products that we need to survive or be perfectly healthy that is not present in plant-based options. Many would say B12, but that is naturally found in soil and we don’t have the same levels now due to sterilisation, however it is present in a vegan diet through supplementation. If you think that supplementation is unhealthy, then you should know that we get B12 through meat as the livestock is injected with supplements.

To reutilize the boomer example, a topic for which they're usually held to contempt is the issue of climate change, and how as a generation they have mostly failed to make any significant progress in this field and have in fact caused a majority of the major climate problems we face today.

I personally believe the above to be a fair criticism/assessment of the boomer generation, all this to say that I don't think these groups are free from any sort of criticism. However, the use of the term ""ok boomer"" whenever someone who either is or appears to be a boomer comes up in discussion would qualify, in my opinion, as both harassment and non contributive to any discussion at hand.

Most people will respond to this claim saying that the term isn't meant to literally describe all baby boomers, but I feel this defense is only paper thin, as I think you'd be hard pressed to blame a baby boomer for feeling offended or attacked by someones use of the term, even if it isn't directed towards them personally.

To go back to climate change, 99.99% of the boomer population isn't directly to blame for the climate crisis, though most of them certainly contributed to it, I don't feel it's fair to toss an entire generations burden onto a given individual with phrases like ""okay boomer"". Phrases like this generalize, and are generally used to just avoid making a point which could then be argued against. They're a lazy catch-all which only serve to alienate and avoid any constructive discussion."	1	
t3_6453w7	CMV: Overpopulation is the root cause of all other environmental crises currently affecting our biosphere.	"I was just reading an article that summarized (in list form) the major environmental crises currently affecting the planet.  The author of the article was of the opinion that overpopulation was the root cause of all other crises (like climate change, ocean acidification, deforestation, water pollution, etc.), and that we wouldn't be able to gain significant traction on solving the other issues until we manage to curb or control our breeding.  Although, and I've read from a lot of other sources that this is indeed the scientific consensus, the author notes that possibly the greatest threat to the biosphere (global warming caused by man-made greenhouse gas emissions) has already advanced past the tipping point and that we can no longer reverse the damage done.  

As regards overpopulation, I have read that the rate of reproduction has been slowing steadily, even in less developed countries around the world.  The world population does continue to climb, and currently stands at almost 7.5 billion, but that still seems like a massive improvement over the runaway population growth experienced in the decades after the second world war.  What does CMV think?  Is overpopulation the root of all environmental evils in the world?  Would overcoming this issue ease and maybe effectively solve other issues, like the pacific garbage patch?

t3_20apvh	I think LENR/cold fusion research is being unreasonably repressed. CMV.	"First, I'm well aware of the fiasco that was 1989 on the cold fusion front. It was at the very least a disaster.
However, since then, any scientist who so much as implies interest in the field, or any inclination to try the experiment, can have their entire credibility put into question, or be labeled a fraud, or a fringe scientist.
On top of that, anyone who does research it, particularly those who DO find excess heat and/or nuclear products are being disregarded without any real look into their results. (Even the MANY peer reviewed reports)
My point is basically: http://www.lenrnews.eu/evidences-that-lenr-is-real-beyond-any-reasonable-doubt/

t3_3gx1q4	"CMV: Organic farming, if it has not failed already, will in the future no longer be as sustainable as conventional farming. We will need a new food label that is science-based and accurately grades the sustainability of food."	"Organic farming was created in opposition to conventional agriculture and the increasing use of science to help grow our food. Organic proponents thought that going back to nature would lead to more sustainable farming.

In some ways, they are right. Cover cropping, reducing reliance on monocultures, good soil management, crop rotation, etc are all very good practices that help make organic farming more sustainable.

However, organic farming, specifically referring to certified organic farming, will ultimately fail because it is prevented from using advanced breeding techniques like genetic engineering (GMOs), as well as advanced synthetic inputs.

In the future, if opposition to agri biotech does not increase to even higher levels, I can easily imagine conventional farmers using a variety of genetically engineered plants that will be more nutritious and more environmentally sustainable.

Organic yields will likely increase over the next few decades as farmers improve practices and use non-biotech technology, however, at a certain point, the advancements of GM crops will make conventional agriculture much more efficient than organic farming.

So, at a certain point, if we are not already passed this point, the ""organic"" label will not represent sustainable farming. However, unless a new labelling scheme is implemented, consumers will still buy organic foods thinking it is better for their health or the environment.

If organic farmers want to keep using the ""organic label"", then that's fine. But I think the USDA should implement a more science-based label that is based on data and technology and more accurately reflects the sustainability of different farming practices.

In the future, we will have network connected microsensors that monitor soil and air quality. They will plug into cloud-based computer modeling systems that will be able to crunch the data and provide an unprecedented level of information. 

All of this data, as well as our knowledge of climate systems and farming, can then be used to create a label that can show the true level of sustainability for any given farm and food. This will also be a label that is dynamic, adjusting based on scientific discoveries and advancements in AI and computer science.

If we want to reduce our impact on climate change and ecosystems, then we would benefit from embracing technology and educating consumers. Unfortunately, the organic label will eventually become a relic of the past, no longer providing any useful indicator of sustainability, but rather representing an era of counterculture farming that was not able to achieve its admirable goals.

t3_nwoxfq	CMV: Choosing to Eat Meat is Barbaric and Evil	"I became a vegetarian when I was around 11. I had made the connection between the animals I loved and meat at 8 and took a few more years to get the confidence to start cooking because my parents refused to make two meals and didn't know how to eat vegetarian. Now it's easy, endless recipes and resources available. So many illuminating studies and data showing how harmful it is....

I just don't understand how anyone can make this choice. We KNOW animals develop relationships with each other, with humans. We know they feel fear, pain, loss and can sense danger. We know they can experience depression under poor living conditions, lack of social interaction. So why are people okay with eating them when it isn't necessary for human survival? As the dominant intelligent species, I feel we have an obligation to the planet to choose vegetarianism.

And there are other reasons too...

Eating meat destroys ecosystems, contributes greatly to climate change.

It is often the source of why we have pandemics including COVID19!

But how... how can people feel they are good when they eat chickens that were modified to be so fat they cant walk? They are so sweet. They love friendship and community. They love to play. They love interacting with humans. They develop families. Their sensibility is in between cats and dogs. 

Pigs are just like dogs! They are silly and rambunctious and affectionate. They love to cuddle and play. They are smart and can interact with humans in intellectual ways. 

Octopi are highly intelligent. Possibly close to humans, they just live in the water.

We know the meat industry creates a lot of waste and suffering as well as human rights violations.

We know the low grade feed and conditions affect our own health and longevity, contributing to aging, poor skin, lethargy. Breaking down meat puts stress on our bodies.

We package meat in ways to attempt to forget what we've done. We use plastic and create waste shipping it all over the world. 

People find puppy mills to be horrifying, but not slaughterhouses???

I could go on and on. But I truly believe it's the second most abhorrent thing to participate in after something like human genocide/holocaust. To rip sentient beings from their families, communities, friends often after torturing and terrorizing them just to create unnecessary, unhealthy food or worse material goods.

-Im fine with dairy and animal products if obtained in an ethical way. I am vegan when I cant source/trace the animal products.

-This judgement does not include communities that do not have the resources to be vegetarian for whatever reason. I am fine with hunting and killing animals out of true necessity as other species do.

t3_7wusbr	"CMV: Animal rights people are increasing hijacking conservation movements. Aside from being an annoyance, this represents a problem of these programs being driven by emotional *do-not-kill* arguments rather than verifiable science."	"They’re doing it with shark conservation, grizzly conservation and whale conservation.  I’ll discuss only the latter.  OK, the term “hijack” is too strong.  Let’s say *re-directing or distorting.* Or maybe *commandeering.*  

I’m open to finding a better term.

Conservation is a practice/outlook created by hunters many decades ago.  Think Theodore Roosevelt (often considered the ""conservationist president”).  Conservation means *wise use.*  Use means just what it says--consumption.  As in hunting.  Or harvesting.

Three nations hunt whale: Norway, Iceland and Japan. (There is also some aboriginal whaling).  There has long been a global movement to halt all whale hunting.  It heavily pressures these 3 nations.

Some whale populations are rising, particularly the humpback.

http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-23/humpback-whale-population-increasing-like-crazy-say-scientists/7872122


Iceland hunts the minke whale.  IUCN listing:  “least concern”

http://www.iucnredlist.org/details/2474/0


The Minke and many Humpback populations are doing well.  Neither extinction nor serious population depletion are pending issues for some whale species. 

Several other arguments have been advanced to protect all whale species:  1) They should not be killed because they are highly intelligent; 2)  They are so large that killing them constitutes cruelty;  2) Humans regard them as special.

These reasons are fine. I do not see a compelling reason to hunting.  But these are not *conservation* arguments.  For lack of a better term, one can call them *preservationist* arguments.  As in *no use.*

But the animal right activists (masquerading as conservationists) don’t want to fess up.   Ask them *Is there any point to which whale populations might rise where a sustainable (hunting) yield might be taken?*  

They dodge the Q and say something unverifiable like:  *Whale populations could fall any time.*   Conceivably they could.  And conceivably a meteor could hit Earth in a month.

These animal right activists insist they are conservationists.  No they’re not.  

And if a conservation movement has evolved to the point where it is heavily wrapped up in sentimental *animal protection narratives*  AND the movement is unwilling to definitely state that at some point the species in question *might* re-open to hunting, then the movement is not conservationist.  

It’s preservationist.  And should be identified as such.

t3_99rddx	CMV: There is no evidence for the existence of free will.	"On a macroscopic level the universe appears deterministic, e.g. if you throw a ball and know the initial conditions you can predict where it will land.

Although I do not know the specifics, I am aware that there are some events on the quantum level which are truly random which would mean that determinism is not valid. However, randomness is not equivalent to choice. For example, if you roll a die to decide what to do you are not making the decision, hence no will is exerted.

From this premise, I would conclude there is no free will as everything which happens is the culmination of the causal chain started with the creation of the universe, with some events that occur being random in nature.

As such, while I do not believe that if we had perfect knowledge we could predict the future, there also does not seem to be any evidence for free will's existence in our current scientific understanding of the universe.

Therefore, any belief in in free will is unfounded and entirely faith based.

t3_3bghs5	"CMV: AI will inevitably spell the end of the vast majority of humans by making the ""proleteriat"" no longer necessary and at the same time rendering revolution impossible for the first time in history. This problem is largely ignored, VERY close and we urgently have to take radical steps to avoid it."	"Ok, this is something that's been bothering me for a while now. It's certainly a ""hot"" topic and this fear is nothing new in the world, on reddit or on /r/CMV. My post focuses on an approach I haven't really seen, but more importantly I believe we're not nearly in as much of a panic as we should be.

So, let's start by saying I'm a huge fan of AI, automation and technology. In fact I'm studying computer science.

The popular fear, and one the likes of Elon Musk or Stephen Hawking have recently subscribed to, is that robots will go bat-shit crazy, for any of the many possible reasons, and just wipe us out. That's a possibility, but I consider it unlikely for a mountain of reasons. Though it's not really what I want to talk about or what I'm worried about, sure, let's keep the possibility in mind.



What I'm afraid of is *people*. Like I mentioned, my view is twofold and two kinds of people shape those 2 aspects. First, it's the people in power and then the rest of us, who I believe to be dangerously oblivious. Whether you want to go so far as to call rich, powerful people ruthless sociopaths or be more restrained in your criticism, the fact remains that the system is incredibly skewed. It has been skewed since time immemorial, and while those at the bottom are doing better, those at the top are doing vastly better. Whether they're evil, ruthless and immeasurably selfish or just rationalizing, naive and blind, it's an indisputable fact that a handful of them are eating most of the cake. People are literally dying while the people in power shrug it off while drinking caviar infused Kopi Luwak on their private island-yacht-jets. 

Joking aside, people are hungry and dying and the environment is getting fucked while those who fuck it deny it. The wealth gap is widening, banks are totally out of control, NSA and its ilk are spying on everyone everywhere. In the US slightly raising the minimum wage is hotly debated, prisons are for profit slave camps, college is comically expensive along with healthcare and corporations have more voting power than entire states. I really could go on and on, but you all get the point and you all know these things. Yes, we're alright, though. We're on reddit, have our computers, Netflix and internet, jobs, cars and happy lives. However, the fact remains that very few have vastly more than everyone else combined and that they show absolutely no interest in changing them. Not that I blame them, we don't either. I'm alright with my middle class lifestyle and I don't send food to Africa or volunteer in a soup kitchen.

So, I don't believe it's a conspiracy, or that anyone is necessary evil. Those people just have a great position and the tools to defend that position. Everyone in their right mind would do the same. It's the social contract, right? Ok, so the point here is to illustrate that the system is unfair, for one reason or another, and that those who are favored by it will do whatever it takes to keep it that way with no guilty conscience. No biggie, we'll tolerate it until it becomes intolerable and then it will change, peacefully or otherwise. History repeats itself, right? The many become fed up, realize they're actually the many and take down the few. 


A great quote, very relevant here. It's totally true, we all know it and we'll act upon it when the time comes like we always have. That's exactly what I'm afraid won't happen. For the first time ever in the history of the world there is a game changer - AI or robots.

Things change and evolve based on pure, brutal efficiency. Once self driving cars become better, we'll use them. Once a robot screws on bottle caps better and makes more money, companies use it. This whole idea is also something commonly talked about, jobs will disappear, automation will take over. The self driving cars destroying the economy by replacing an insane amount of workers is a known potential issue. Why pay a person with all their flaws when a robot will do the job perfectly? It's just a natural progression of capitalism. No big deal, though, we'll revolt if it turns out disadvantageous. There's more of us, right?

**Wrong**

For the first time ever, the 99% will be outnumbered and outgunned by the 1%. Robots. You won't have fighter robots, I won't have fighter robots. The governments, the corporations and the rich will have them. With 90% of the wealth, they'll have at least 90% of the better, stronger, more durable, emotionless armies that don't sleep, question orders, feel pain or need training. The rich and powerful will use us and tolerate us because they need us, just like always. For the first time ever, though, we'll reach a point where they don't. We won't provide cheap labor, our role as consumers will be obsolete and unnecessary and we'll simply take up space and resources. Space and resources we won't be able to defend because **for the first time in human history power will no longer be an illusion**. The few will actually be powerful while the many will actually be powerless. Imagine the French revolution that's met with 500 000 Terminators garrisoned in the Versailles.

Whether it's the intelligence part of AI, the brute and strength of robot armies or the superior labor efficiency, *all of it will primarily benefit those in power*. And they have demonstrated time and again we're just expendable merchandise tolerated because we build the yachts and the villas. Just like how you and I are letting children in Africa starve (metaphor for all of our selfishness), they will let us starve. 

All of this has already begun. People are noticing and fearing the militarization of the police, but even they're people. They have kids and families and make a paycheck. They can become fed up too. Robots can't. We have cars that drive themselves, missiles that navigate autonomously, experimental AI drones and incredibly sophisticated AI software in planes, ships, tanks etc. It's going to take literally 5, max 10 years before power will be backed by an army of invincible fucking transformers. You're not comfortable with the power and weapons cops have? Don't worry, they'll be fighting on your side in a few years and will prove to be absolutely useless, just like everyone else. 

I constantly see people referencing how the system is bound to change or collapse. How they're worried about their kids paying for college. How solar or nuclear will solve the energy needs in 20-30 years and we'll be close to a utopia. Finishing college, picking careers, wondering what the 8th season of a new show will look like. None of that will happen, we're all totally fucked. 


This is the only logical progression of events, and if no one interferes this *will* happen, no doubt about it. The problem is, this is the *very* **near future** and no one at all is talking about it. Not the politicians, the scientists nor the average Joe. We're occasionally, almost jokingly worrying about what some super advanced AI may do to us in 40 years, all the while totally neglecting the fact that one average human and many stupid robots can present a threat *tomorrow*. We need to act now and put the systems in place to prevent this. Fix politics, fix capitalism, fix democracy NOW because it's literally the last fucking chance.





TL;DR: While scary, smart AI could potentially be an issue in 50 years, no one is aware of another huge, real and very close risk. People with money and power have demonstrated they value it far more over innocent lives and that they're not interested in sharing it fairly. These people will soon inevitably have many, many dumb robots to work for them and protect them. The 99% will become obsolete and for the first time in human history, it won't be able to fight or revolt against the 1%. This will happen very soon, both the weapon and labor aspects are in motion all the while the common person has less relative wealth, power, is being increasingly monitored, restricted and censored. We're *this* close to being no longer useful and none of this is a conspiracy or evil, it's just pragmatism. **There will be no 1984, no totalitarian society - we'll simply be left for dead because we're no longer needed.**





Changing my view is not showing me I'm not 100% right, but only 99% instead. So please refrain from pointing out any minor/unlikely eventualities I may not have specified or using tools and arguments for the sole purpose of me being not 100% right. For example things like ""we can all die from a meteor impact, thus it's possible that robots won't undoubtedly spell our destruction"" or ""it's totally possible we switch to perfecto-communism overnight"". To change my view, it takes something that's likely, not something that's possible. In other words I want to know why what I'm saying is not *likely* and why there's no need for everyone to be more worried, proactive and take this issue far more seriously. 

Frankly, I don't really care that much about my *view* per se, and wouldn't mind having it changed (respecting the paragraph above). I really wanted to get some discussion going as I think this is a huge issue which manages to just slip by undetected. 



A) A good amount of the replies didn't read my post *at all*. 

B) A good amount of the replies are completely ignoring what I said in my penultimate paragraph and are arguing about inane bullshit, focusing on being pedantic and not changing my view in any meaningful way. To be honest, I don't really mind that as much as I though, provided they too are aware we're just taking the piss and having fun.

C)  I figured out a key word of this whole business, and that word is *leverage*. Once automation takes over, those not in power simply no longer have any leverage. Even if for no good reason and contrary to all historical evidence we're allowed to stick around, we're literally pets. Nothing we may request, demand or threaten has any weight behind it. I'm still 100% of the opinion that we'll just be left for dead, but since I also intended this as a ""food for thought"" post, this is for the ""the 1% don't murder for sport so it's all gonna be good"" crowd.

D) Once again, if by some ridiculous magic the governments assume a completely benevolent role and save us all, it's still fucked. For the first time in history, there's nothing we can do about it all if they do a 180. Similar to the whole surveillance thing and the ""I don't do anything wrong"" argument, where you could get ruined retroactively by a change in policy/law or simply be set up for one reason or another.
An omnipotent government is bad, there is not debating that.



First, on this magical war, which is not something that happens just for fun, nor is it required to happen for this to still be a major issue and spell destruction:


Second, on the nature of those in power. It's not really meant to call anyone out and you could be the most selfless person on Earth, please refrain from mentioning things like that. The point of it is to illustrate that it doesn't take *evil* and that shit like this can be caused by normal, every day people. (Not to mention the ones who have a proven track record of being abusive cunts)

t3_oakh0c	CMV: The urgency of the environmental crisis justifies the use of violence by ecologists	"The global scientific consensus is that we've reached/are reaching past the tipping point of preventable future suffering when it comes to the harms climate change and natural resources depletion will bring to the human society. 

To summarize just a couple of the predictions most of them agree on:

 \- Water will become a disputed resource in multiple regions of the world (already is in some), which will lead to wars and authoritative regimes breakouts 

 \- The scarcity of water and disrupted weather cycles will threaten food security, prompting lower standards of living, famines, etc... which will cause massive movements of population (we're talking 100 000 000s here). This also means wars for the foreseeable future

 \- Adverse ""natural"" events such as floods, lethal heatwaves, pandemics, etc... will multiply in consequence to the compounded effects of human activity on this planet. This will also contributes to the migrations described above

Let's suppose that we all agree with this consensus. Even if these events are bound to happen, we could still mitigate their harm by putting in place some of the measures scientists and/or ecologists advocate for, which would allow us to still avoid part of the human suffering that seems promised to us.

Unfortunately, scientific proof, argumentation, the standard political path (electoral process, lobbying...), peaceful protestation, nor art seem to move the needle remotely enough.

In this context of extreme urgency, the use of violence as a way to move that needle for ecological gains is justified morally and logically since it brings change faster than any other path.

&#x200B;

**Violence doesn't entail direct harm to people in my view**. I'm thinking about destruction of private property owned by the most polluting companies, neutralizing of supply chains that don't respect international standards of pollution... 

For example:

 [Drought-hit California moves to halt Nestlé from taking millions of gallons of water](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/apr/27/california-nestle-water-san-bernardino-forest-drought)

In this instance, I believe violence is justified, for example by blocking access to water sources from the company or destroying its pumping equipment.

&#x200B;

**Please note again that my view is not that any violence is justified in this context. I'm talking calculated, targeted violence that serves the sole purpose of acting as a dissuading factor against entities (mostly companies) that considerably contribute to the environmental crisis.** Violence to people is excluded from my view. Destruction of a random supermarket that imports spoons from China is excluded. Destruction of Nestlé water pumps as in the previous example is included. Destruction of a Saudi Aramco gas extraction installation is included.

Whether violence has drawbacks and adverse effects is not really my point here. I think we all know it does. It doesn't mean that it isn't justified. If you want to bring up the flaws of violence as I describe it, you're of course free to do so, but please do not feel frustrated if it doesn't end up changing my view as I'm already aware of at least some of those."	1

t3_4xd3a6	CMV: Eating meat is immoral and future generations will look back on our current farming practices with horror	"Since a diet without animal products can give us everything we need, it's unnecessary. It's also grossly inefficient and immoral. The fact that we do it anyway will shock future generations in a similar way to how we're shocked at various injustices of our past such as human slavery. 

I hope this isn't too long. I wanted to explain why it's so unnecessary, and answer some of the main arguments people first think of, to avoid a lot of unnecessary comments.

**Animal welfare**

We recognize well enough to put it into law that animals deserve to be treated decently, at least when it comes to dogs and cats, but when it comes to something like a pig—which is more intelligent than dogs, cats, and young children—we feel justified imprisoning creatures, cutting their lives short, and slaughtering and eating them for what seems to amount to nothing more than ""because we feel like it"" or ""we're used to it"".

That it's normal, natural, and tastes nice doesn't mean it's moral. E.g., human slavery was once normal and considered natural, and it's ""natural"" to do many things we no longer do since progressing as a species and living in civilized societies. 

That an animal was bred to be slaughtered and eaten isn't a justification, cultural norms aren't justifications, and our own pleasure certainly isn't. And any argument for necessary nutrition is fully debunked (save for some rare cases where people have severely restricted diets perhaps).

A species can be considered endangered and Reddit will *tear a country apart* for killing an animal of that species. In fact, it doesn't even have to be endangered. I saw a post recently about people killing animals, perhaps elephants or something, and I was floored to see people making the same exact arguments against these practices that I would make against eating meat. I don't see how killing an elephant because I enjoy the ivory is much different from killing a cow because I enjoy the taste of its flesh. They're both unnecessary and there are alternatives for both.

**Inefficiency and climate change**

Growing plants solely to feed animals (and then eating the animals) will always be insanely more inefficient than just eating the plants to begin with. The fact that it can sometimes be as cheap to buy meat (as a consumer) is shocking and the fault lies with government subsidies etc.

Because we breed, feed and slaughter 50 billion animals a year, animal agriculture causes 51% of greenhouse gas emissions. That we're aware of this and that it's unnecessary (much more so than driving cars or creating energy), it's shocking that we're doing very little about it. Meat will always be more expensive than plants (even if not directly to the individual consumer). We waste a huge amount of food on animal agriculture like this, but we still have people starving in the world. How will future generations feel about that?

**I don't think people are wrong to eat meat**

Some people will find themselves in circumstance where they cannot comfortably live without meat, particularly outside of the developed world, but many in the U.S. lack the education to cook anything else/or even time to cook at all, while McDonalds has $1 burgers. 

I used to eat meat and I understand how embedded in our culture it is, and that the majority of people have never thought about it beyond a few arguments which seem sound on the surface. But all the arguments I'm aware of—and when you don't eat meat you quickly become very familiar with all the pro-eat arguments people can think of—they aren't able to hold up to any real scrutiny and they generally fall apart when applying to anything else. 

E.g., you might say ""eating meat is okay because it's natural"". But you only need to use the same argument for something else to show how absurd the argument is, such as ""murder is okay because it's natural"". Note: This isn't comparing animals to humans, it's applying the same appeal to nature to something else to show it's a weak argument. If your response is ""but animals aren't people"" then ""because it's natural"" wasn't your argument to begin with.

**Insects and mice are killed while harvesting plants, and also plants have feelings**

Plants aren't sentient and don't ""feel pain"" anything like animals do. However, eating plants *is* necessary for us to live, therefore justified regardless. Even if plants were sentient beings, animal agriculture still kills many more of them. Abolishing animal agriculture would therefore cut down on most of those deaths, too.

**What if animals are raised on a nice farm and humanely slaughtered**

""Free range"" aren't running around on green farms all happy and playing with their animal pals like we picture them. But still, 99% of animals are not free range and we couldn't eat meat at the levels we do if they were. 

There's nothing humane or compassionate about humans causing unnecessary suffering and death. And it's not at all uncommon for the slaughter methods to go wrong. I cannot watch a video of pigs being slaughtered so I don't know how I could justify my decision to pay for it to happen. The industry lobbies hard for secrecy and in many places it's illegal for us to see what's even going on, which seems pretty crazy to me.

**In summary:**

Eating meat seems to be as unnecessary as anything can be. It's also insanely inefficient and contributes more to global warming than everything else combined. Considering the harm to the planet, animals, and humans, it cannot be justified.

Future generations who have the luxury of hindsight and lab grown meat will be shocked at our practices (when you're no longer personally/emotionally invested in something it's a lot easier to be shocked about it) in a similar way to how we feel about slavery.

Thanks.

t3_3cvas1	CMV: The assumption that alien life exists is wildly optimistic	"Its pretty common to encounter people, including a decent number of reputable astrophysicists, who believe that the odds of life existing on other planets are so high as to be a near-certainty. These assumptions, as far as I can tell, tend to be based on the size and age of the universe (i.e. huge and old), particularly the number of ""earth-like"" planets.

But its my understanding that in fact knowing exactly how ""earth-like"" a planet is is pretty difficult, and that many planets listed as ""earth-like"" may not actually be earth-like in enough of the ways that matter--in other words, just because a planet is roughly earth-sized, roughly the right distance from a sun, and features heavy elements, doesn't actually mean that it in any way is earth-like *enough* to support life. In fact, it is entirely possible that planets which can support life are vanishingly rare, much rarer than most estimates based on ""earth-like"" planets seem to acknowledge.

In addition, the odds that a planet which does meet earth-like criteria actually will develop life are basically totally unknown--anthropic bias and the fact that we literally only have only one model planet to observe makes actually nailing down the odds of abiogenesis on some other, non-earth planet very difficult to estimate. And while it is true that abiogenesis seems to have occured roughly soon after conditions on earth met the necessary preconditions as we understand them, it is also my understanding that as far as we can tell abiogenesis only happened once on earth, with all life on earth ultimately stemming from a common origin. If abiogenesis were really common once the necessary preconditions were met, why hasn't it kept happening?

TL;DR I think most estimates of the number of planets which actually meet the necessary conditions for abiogenesis (rather than just being broadly earth-like), and for the likelihood of abiogenesis occuring once conditions have been met, are very possibly way too high, and that it is just as likely if not moreso that both planets which can support life and abiogenesis on such planets are infinitesimally rare. While I would never say with 100% certainty that alien life does not exist, I am unconvinced by those who say it almost certainly does.

t3_agzrhu	CMV: The world is screwed beyond repair	"1. everyone refuses slow down consumption of meat and the cows farting is killing the planet with climate change (look it up it’s actually the number 1 cause of climate change)

2. The most militarized country (both civilian and professional) in the world (The United States) is polarized and on the brink of war with itself (I’m slightly exaggerating but only slightly), and I’m afraid other countries (like Russia) would take advantage of our weakness and try to invade or something, causing more countries to interfere and cause a world war. (This is only my first theory of how world war 3 could start)

3. We have a trigger happy person in charge of the U.S. and I’m afraid he WANTS to get in a war with other countries. (I’m a libertarian by the way so I actually voted for him because of my hate for Hillary but that’s besides the point)

4. The United States has a great economy right now, but last time we had that, 2008 happened, and I’m afraid that something similar would happen again. America would then stop mass consumption, causing other countries (like China) to go broke causing more countries to go broke and so on, causing a worldwide depression. (Just a theory calm down)

5. Drug use is on the rise, and people are blaming other countries (mainly the U.S. blaming Mexico) instead of the individuals. I pray this doesn’t cause Trump to go beserk, pissing off other countries starting a war.

There are many more things I could say, but I’m getting bored. XD I personally believe no matter who the U.S. chose in 2016, we would be screwed, so don’t attack me for being; “too one sided”

t3_9z3084	CMV: Colonizing Mars is a Waste of Time and Resources	"Let me just say first that I am an engineering student and currently doing independent research on the subject of Mars life support systems.  So I am somewhat educated on the subject of what it is like to live on Mars, and have a great interest in it as a possibility for the future of human civilization.

That said, from what I've learned about the conditions on Mars, it is a complete waste of time to try to actually set up permanent settlements on the red planet.  Here's why I think this.

First, the climate is just too harsh.  Temperatures vary between -243*F at the poles and a high of 68*F at the equator.  This is a wide fluctuation, but the overall average is that it is a cold planet, that will require a tremendous amount of resources to keep the habitat modules warm.  On top of this, there are frequent dust storms.  This means that we must use some form of non-sun dependent power system for electricity.  It also means that everything needs to be cleaned on a regular basis so the dust doesn't foul up instruments and equipment. 

Then there's the water quality.  First the state of the water.  Most of the water we've found is frozen solid, so much so that you would need a diamond tip drill bit to get through it.  The water that may not be frozen is only liquid because it is incredibly salty with perchlorates.  Perchlorates are highly toxic to humans, so you need to develop efficient methods to remove the perchlorates from the water.  All of this is incredibly labor and energy intensive.

Then there's the distance.  We would be so far from earth that should there be any kind of emergency, it would already be well under way before earth got any word of it, and then if there needed to be help sent, it would take most of a year to get someone there.  In terms of just the travel time, you are basically asking people to take 10 months to travel to a barren, cold, dusty planet with toxic water.  Do you really think a lot of people will be interested in that kind of time commitment, once they see what the quality of life will be like?

Lastly, the reason many people cite for wanting to colonize Mars is to have a backup plan in case of extinction, usually from an asteroid.  To paraphrase Neil Degrass Tyson, the effort it takes to colonize Mars is likely equal or greater than just simply diverting an incoming asteroid.  So that is a rather flimsy excuse for going through all the time and effort to live on a poorly suited planet.

Overall, I do get why people want to travel to Mars.  We have an innate desire to explore and push the boundaries of civilization, and answer questions about life on other planets.  However, living on Mars is just foolish, especially when we have several closer frontiers we have yet to explore.  These include the bottoms of the oceans, Antarctica, and the moon.  These places are equally challenging to live, and yet we don't see nearly as many efforts to try to colonize these places.  Why not?  They are equally interesting, have a lot of resources we could use, and are within a short distance, so people can travel there easily and communicate with existing civilization quickly.  The moon for one would serve the ""extinction prevention"" function that most people cite for wanting to colonize Mars, and would be the most practical and easy to achieve stepping stone towards becoming a multi-planet species.  For tourism, I think many people would be much more inclined to go to the moon, which only takes a few days, and would have stunning views of earth.

To be clear, I don't think having small manned missions to Mars and building a surface and orbital base is a bad idea.  We should definitely do that, and explore the red planet to the fullest extent.  The main thing I'm arguing against here is long term large scale settlements.  It may end up being  a place where people go to do academic studies, but  for long term settlements  of average people, I just don't see it happening.  

So please, change my view that colonizing Mars is a terrible idea."	1	
t3_o16f8t	CMV: Republicans will not confirm any Supreme Court nominations as early as 2023 if they regain control of the Senate.	"I see a lot of headlines saying that McConnell is saying they likely  wouldn't confirm a nominee in 2024 if they have control of the Senate.   Haven't Republicans already made clear that they've changed the process  so that anytime they hold power in the Senate they will not hold a vote  on whether or not to confirm a Democratic nominee?  How they handled the  replacements of Scalia and RBG clearly demonstrated that it was not  about how much time was left, but who controlled power in the Senate.  The new process is that if a justice passes away while different parties control the presidency and the Senate, then that seat remains open for up to two years.  I would argue, they've even opened the door to blocking nominations for up to four years should these those conditions exist.  I have a hard time visualizing a situation where it goes 6 years without the Senate and presidency being controlled by the same party."	1	
t3_78xvz1	"CMV: Science is held up up as some pure bastion of unadulterated truth, when in reality, it’s often subjective and/or inconclusive."	"Today, “science” seems to be just another religion with millions of people that put their blind faith in without question or test. And just like Christianity of old, proponents will scoff at and shun anyone who is skeptical of it in its currently established form. 

Now I’m not a flat-earther or anti-vaxer trying to gain a platform; obviously the scientific process has helped us understand truth in countless ways. But the entire history of science is about overturning established conclusions and consensuses, and I think anyone who unconditionally accepts and molds their world view to whatever today’s scientific consensus is is just as blind as a religious zealot who refuses to acknowledge scientific observations of the world. 

This sentiment is obviously different in its application to various schools of science: it’s simple to understand chemistry because we can easily observe the cause and effect, like a math problem. Things like behavioral science and climatology are different because patterns are much more spurious and subjective to personal bias and interpretation. 

As somebody who has participated in research and reporting at university, I know that studies are easy to manipulate (whether intentionally or not) based on the goals and biases of the researcher. There’s a reason why you can look at recent studies on any topic and find wide varieties of conclusions of the same question; because each study has a different goal or agenda...someone seeking to either confirm of deny a certain premise. Anyone else that has participated in scientific research should be able to confirm that factors of personal belief or bias can greatly affect one’s conclusion, even with a well-designed experiment. 

The fact is, science is always changing but too many people treat it like it’s a settled issue in all cases and worship it as the savior of humankind, when any scientist is aware of how little we truly understand about the world and new information is constantly coming forward. If we take science as it sits and hold it up as some supreme truth, we’ll be 1) stunting our future growth by stifling discourse and experimentation, and 2) doing humanity a moral disservice by beating society into conformity with information and conclusions that may well be incorrect and later proved wrong. 

To be concise, I don’t wish to debate about any particular scientific issue, but believe that science is best served by skepticism in general, and that society is unwisely trending towards treating established scientific principles as the God of the new age: an entity to be bowed down to, praised, and never questioned.

t3_2phe1z	"CMV: I'm a cynic and there is no hope for mankind, and we deserve it"	"Hello all.  
This is a plead to get some counters to problems I see with us.  Below is a list of things in no particular order that I have problems with, that I forsee causing the collapse of the human race as a species.  It may not be now, or 100 years from now, but I believe these all will contribute to a world in which I'm thankfully not going to be a part of.  I'm very cynical and I think I've reached a point in my life where I don't want to be.  But I really don't see anything in this world that's worth fighting for.  So I just exist here, everyone else seems happy around me and good for them.

This is a generalization of things I see being a problem and I know some are very over-simplified, so forgive me that, but counter-arguments or some proof of change on each of these would be a nice change.

**Waste (garbage, plastics, etc)**

There are so many garbage dumps, miles of garbage in the ocean, and polluted rivers, waterways, etc that eventually the earth will be just one big pile of garbage.  See Wall-E for an example of my views.  Sure we may eventually start a 'cleanup initiative' but it will be too late. 

**Pollution (C02, etc)**

Climate change is happening and people deny it's existence.  The evidence is there but people don't like to accept things that go against their beliefs, no matter how much evidence you have.  Thus our planet is on course to be a planet devoid of any life without some intervention of us.

**Wildlife**

We routinely don't care about animals going extinct.  People say 'its just a dumb animal' or whatnot, thankfully there are steps being taken here, but the ivory trade is going strong, tigers are going extinct, rhinos, etc.   We just can't help our greed and eventually we'll be reading about the last of each of those species dying off.

**Cultural/Religious differences**

I tell my friends I'm not racist at all, I'm more 'cultural-ist' if that's a thing.  I think middle-east culture should change, I feel they're still in the medieval ages like old Christians were.  Some Christians still are, but everytime I hear about some father killing his daughter because she was raped is just asinine.  Or this morning's school raid by the Taliban for another example.

**Politics and corruption**

It seems each country has it's own political issues.  From Mexico and police corruption/drug cartels, Russia invading other countries, Britains pedophelia scandal, Indias political corruption, America's political corruption, Australia and Tony Abott.  The people in power just help themselves and do whatever it takes to stay there.

**Overpopulation**
All in all, people are a plague on the world, we don't need this many people.  Even if half the world died,  thats still 3.5 billion people left.  We're really not hurting in the food chain even with halving the population.  You and your children (mine included) are not special (to everyone else) and would have no impact on the world if they weren't here.

t3_92ownj	CMV: Plastic bottled water should be banned.	"In 2017, 13.7 million bottles have been consumed by Americans. About 70 percent of those water bottles aren't recycled. You probably already know that plastic bottles that aren't recycled, end up in land fills, bodies of water, etc. Plastic water bottles also uses our natural resources like petroleum (crude oil) which then pollutes our environment through degradation or even in the process of making the plastic, overall causing a large disturbance to our planet through climate change and pollution.

In addition to plastic water bottles being harmful to the environment, banning plastic bottles encourages money conservation and breaks down the 1% and the 99% discrepancy with the plastic bottle industry. The plastic water bottle industry is increasingly taking money from consumers through just bottling water in plastic bottles. The average price of water in the United states is about $1.50 per 1000 gallons (tap). Bottled water costs around 2000 times the amount of regular tap water. For example, there are incentives of buying cafe/restaurant's reusable bottles or cups and the consumers receive discounts for reusing. Also in certain grocery stores, they offer discounts for reusable bags. Banning plastic bottled water saves money!

I understand that some places don't have those clean water sources to switch off from plastic bottles but the ban could take action after a development of a clean water source.

Alternatives to bottled water could be reusable water bottles, or an increase in water stations (fountains) for public use

t3_b0yza2	"CMV: There is no point for my country to cut our emissions, because China and USA are so massive polluters"	" I want us to fight against climate change. I'd be happy if we can live in a more balanced state with nature. 

I'd also like to believe that what we do in my country matters. But my father recently pointed out to me how little we actually do matter. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_countries\_by\_greenhouse\_gas\_emissions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_greenhouse_gas_emissions)

According to this list, China and USA together make up more than 40% of all emissions in the world. Top five countries alone make up about 55%. Top ten makes almost 65%, or 2/3. 

I live in a country that makes about 0.1%. Even if we managed to cut our emissions down to half (not an easy feat), there would still be 99.95% of the global emissions left. No matter how much we struggled and paid, we barely made a difference. Even if we somehow managed to eliminate our emissions completely, what we accomplished in the big picture basically amounts to a rounding error. When we talk about a situation where we need to reduce our emissions to half or more globally, our share of emissions is nigh meaningless. One big factory blows up in China, and all we did was negated. 

I understand that China is doing stuff to cut its emissions, and it should. It alone is producing 1/4 of all emissions on earth. I do understand the moral value of everyone doing what they can. 

But that is pretty much the only value I can find in our actions. ""Look, I'm helping too"". We are a kid selling lemonade for 1c a piece, when the mortgage is 100,000. We might give some moral boost to the big boys, who are the ones doing the heavy lifting, but that is basically our contribution. 

I also understand that the voting argument might apply here, that ""every vote matters"". 

But I would argue that is not the case here. If this is like voting, then ten people in my population have 65% of vote. If we vote, cool. But what we should do, is try to influence the ten people who hold the actual power, because our voting power is so small, it's not even funny. If we need to act like we are helping, then go for it. Sign the deals, make the appearances. But whether we actually reduce our emissions to half or zero, does not matter. Whether the world is saved or not, is not up to us.

t3_7ovpby	CMV: Globalization is the logical conclusion to a free market.	"Lately it seems the Republican party has been increasingly libertarian on the subject of free market economics. They argue that the market, if left alone, will correct poverty, safety standards, corruption and any number of other things. On the other hand, the rise of Donald Trump coincided with an increase in economically nationalistic philosophies to the point that they've become mainstream in the Republican rhetoric. These philosophies act against one another and can't coexist without the federal government regulating them to fit together, which will diminish one or the other or both, and act against another key Republican tenant."	1	
t3_7eaij3	CMV: I find it difficult to respect vegetarians and vegans that don't proselytize and/or condemn meat eaters	"Disclaimer: I eat meat


When I say ""Vegetarians/vegans"" in the context of this post, I mean those vegetarians/vegans that don't eat meat due to moral reasons. if a vegetarian were to remain principled and consistent, in my opinion, they would try to spread their worldview to meat-eaters. This is because if they believe that slaughtering animals for meat is needless violence against animals, they should try to end this suffering as much as possible. One way they could do this is try to persuade meat eaters to stop eating meat. Additionally, I find it hypocritical for them not to condemn meat-eaters. If they believe that causing animal suffering and contributing to it is morally wrong, they should condemn meat eaters, butchers, etc.

t3_2a5mz6	CMV: Anarcho Capitalism and Libertarianism don't have a solution to complex pollution problems.	"There are many problems with pollution but I just want to concentrate on one particular aspect of it namely pollution from several actors were the amount each actors releases is not harmful but the accumulated amount is. Global warming would be the most prominent form of pollution but I want to concentrate on it on a much smaller level because I think the scope is easier to discuss.

My parents live in a small rural area in Germany with a lot of farming and herding going on. Lately there has been somewhat a boom of biogas plant among the farmes leading to a increased production of rape (the plant). In addition to that there were several new ""farming factories"" created were tens of thousand of pigs and chicken are raised and slaughtered. All of that has lead to a problem for the region: the nitrate levels in the groundwater are slowly rising to dangerous levels. This is caused by the dung and fertilizer the farmers use and the waste of the factory farms.

If you look at each single farm the amount of nitrat released by them is in no way harmful and the oldest farmers in region have been doing so for decades now without causing any quantifiable harm but with the current boom and expension and the omission of a lot of small farms in favour of a few big one has caused the accumulated amount of nitrat in the ground water to rise above the limit values.

In Statistan the responsible authorities namely the local department of agriculture and the local department enviromental protection agency are developing new guidlines for the use as dung of fertilizer and new requirements for factory farms to dispose of their waste. They are working slow (as always) but there has already been some success in neighbouring counties.

Now what would be the solution in Ancapistan were no regulation exist and pollution is mostly dealt with via property rights and damage suits. The invidiual amount and thus harm caused by each actor is zero or close to zero so there is no party you can sue for damages. So what now? The only answer I've gotten so far is the appeal that they would voluntary change in order protect their property. But the big factory farmers don't give shit because they will already leave scorched earth after they moved because they ground will be polluted with all kinds of nasty stuff and the farmers are in fierce competition with each other were they can't afford to change to a more expensive method of fertilizing their fields while their neighbours possible stick with the old and cheaper ones. The local customer who are affected by the pollution can't influence them by ""voting with their wallet"" either because most of the products are sold to large market chains and distributed all over the world. I don't see how anarcho capitalism and libertarianism who doesn't accept enviromental regulation have any solution for this problem.

t3_9u2g0g	CMV: Globalization is one of humanity's (unintentionally) worst achievements	"I'm not saying globalization is an inherently evil idea (I mean, I'm typing this on a laptop that's arguably a global product), but these days I've come to realize that our world might have been better off without it. I have several reasons for believing this:

- The environment and the climate would have been better off. Because of globalization, everyone wants to build sprawling cities and to manufacture all the things just to stay ahead in the competition. The economy may get ahead, but the environment always takes a hit. Because of globalization, populations have grown far more than the planet can sustain and this means people have to go to increasingly extreme measures to get food - using fishing trawlers to kill marine life unnecessarily, destroying coral reefs, farming too many cows, etc.

- Next, there is now a redefined sense of fulfillment. Globalization and consumerism seem to go hand in hand. I don't hate capitalism per se, I just dislike the current form it seems to be taking. Materialism and excess are now the keys to happiness - everyone must own an iPhone, or Porsche, or any of that stuff. There is no joy to be found in a quiet pastoral setting or a small village or an agrarian environment. Everyone wants to make it to the industrial regions - be they cities or states. This causes overcrowded cities and with overcrowding comes crime and all other undesirable elements of urban life. What does this have to do with globalization? Well, everyone wants to make it to the more industrialized states thus not only abandoning the original ones, but overcrowding the destinations (note: this has nothing to do with refugees fleeing war or political persecution).

- Globalization has propped up horrible people and regimes. Some regimes only happen to be in power because some global 'powers' and even less powerful states decide to continue to support them by buying natural resources from them. So long as the oil or diamonds keep coming, these horrible regimes are unlikely to crumble.

- Globalization has disrupted many social ecosystems. I believe that not every society should do things the same way; cultural hegemonies are actually undesirable for the most part because societies aren't the same. Forms, systems or minutiae of government and society don't work the same way or have the same result across societies. Not every country should be a pastiche of Europe or America because the elements that work in these societies may become lost in translation when other societies decide to imitate them. I think societies should be allowed to naturally develop their own sense of government - one that works for them best.

- Ironically, globalization doesn't seem to foster diversity. Globalization seems to be synonymous with 'Westernization'. Now, I don't think that Westernization is inherently a bad thing but as stated earlier, not every society in the world should be a pastiche of the West because it doesn't have the same effect everywhere. Globalization means everyone's speaking English (not a very efficient language, no offense to the British), wearing suits in hot weather, celebrating Christmas (no offense to Christians, but Christmas shouldn't be for everyone), etc.
Even when building sprawling cities, everyone's just copying what the Western countries do. No-one seems to care about being original or asking whether gigantic cities are even necessary and if so, why they are necessary.

- Globalization has caused an increased sense of dread. Not only do we have to deal with horrible local news, we now have to deal with horrible international news! The world is now more connected than ever, which means every locale now shares the tragedies of the world and there are a *lot* of tragedies in the world. This is one of the few cases where I can say that ignorance is bliss. I remember in 2015 or so when the news of the Sandy Hook shootings came up. I felt despondent for days despite not being American and despite having issues to deal with in my own backyard. This isn't even to mention the news of the frequent terrorist bombings that hit several countries like Pakistan, etc. Not to say people should have less empathy, but the world is crappy enough. I don't think we need any more existential dread.

Note that globalization isn't strictly a purely Western thing. I'd say other than the West, the next biggest hegemonies I can think of are the Chinese one (economically speaking) and the Islamic one (culturally speaking).
My point isn't that globalization is an evil thing (I'd say it's a neutral thing). It's just that from a utilitarian standpoint, the world would have been happier in a gross sense without globalization in its current form.
You can change my mind if you show me that my reasons and assumptions are mistaken/misguided, that globalization has done more good than harm, or that the pitfalls of this 'segregated' isolated world with minimal cross-contact would be worse than the pitfalls of our small, global world.

t3_9y362h	CMV: Government inaction is heading us towards irreversible climate catastrophe.	"As time progresses, more and more damning reports which say we are heading for irreversible climate change are being released. Take for example a relatively optimistic report by the [IPCC](http://www.ipcc.ch/) which essentially issues a 12 year deadline to a *point of no return*. A 1.5 degree increase in global temperature will cause massive issues all across the globe, and an increase greater than 2.0 degrees will be will catastrophic for everyone to say the least.

There are many private and public initiatives which are cleaning up our Earth one step at a time. Take for example dutch NGO, The [Ocean Clean Up](https://www.theoceancleanup.com/) which is doing inspiring work coming up with unique and innovative ways to rid the seas of pollution detrimental to marine life.

With this being said, when I look to my and other governments around the world, it's almost as if the message hasn't registered. **I am not saying** that nothing is being done, but more that the people with the most power to evoke change *appear* to be the most lackadaisical about the whole process. In fact in some cases it seems like they only care about making a buck **NOW**.

Take for example Australia. In summary the current ruling party insists that the country rely on coal for electricity even though some states have successfully run completely on renewables and even had an excess of power on their grids (South Australia as the most successful example). The current party is so in love (or paid to be in love) with coal that Prime Minister Scott Morrison even [brought some into parliament](https://www.abc.net.au/news/image/8256064-3x2-940x627.jpg).

With all this being said, I just wonder why the premise of catastrophic climate change isn't causing immediate and noticeable action from governments. The sad irony is the people with the least power to act will be the most affected. I could just blame it on corruption, or lobbying from the industries which perpetuate the problem, but surely those in charge don't have their hands tied that tight? Right? I may not be the most informed person on the topic of climate change, but from my perspective, it sure seems like more could and should be done but just plain isn't. That being said I might be missing something that tears apart my whole view, so please CMV.

TL;DR: There has been consensus that climate is changing, yet from my point of view not enough is being done. This may be due to corruption or other factors. The people with the most power to evoke change should be doing so, but aren't.

t3_l81f42	"CMV: It is literally insane that MAD is the prevailing doctrine behind nuclear policy and will likely result in the slow, painful deaths of many alive today"	"Judging by the efforts of international terrorist organizations, the apathy of legitimate governments regarding nuclear accidents, the continuing advancements in missile tech/ cyberwarfare, rising tide of nationalism, and world leaders willing to lie online while eroding bureaucratic transparency, will ultimately result in nuclear war or a nuclear accident. 
With thermonuclear weapons, the casualties will be instantaneous and, EASILY, in the millions. 

Virtually nothing is stopping a despot from threatening nuclear destruction from the safety of their bunker and any receiving state could only respond with nuclear annihilation in kind. The theory behind Mutual Assured Destruction is that no tyrant wants to rule over a radioactive crater, but that is such a flimsy assumption when the lives of millions and upward human progress since the 1400s hangs in the balance. 

Yet very few people seem to care, however its the same people who ignore the problem are the same souls with which Presidents and Dictators gamble. It is insane to me that people believe that MAD ensures their safety when its little more than a suicide pact between world leaders who would very likely survive any initial nuclear attack. 

Nuclear weapons are hardly a political issue yet they should be the single most important issue on the minds of every single human being. Modern states have the literally Godlike power to singlehandedly destroy the world yet there are astonishingly few current political initiatives to restrict this fact. 

With the chaos and discord seen during 2020 and the willingness for political agents to lie or threaten other leaders with nukes, every person living in a city, without access to a fallout bunker, should be existentially terrified and should vote with this fear in mind.

t3_251izx	"CMV: I believe all major human problems can be solved by temporary population control, restricting people to 1 child per family at most."	"In order for the human population to grow, we need at least 2.5 children per family (to replace both parents + 0.5 kids to cover premature death/infertility/etc), our current world population grows fast, which means people have a lot of kids (3+ on average). By temporarily restricting people to 1 child per family at most, the population will decrease, this has the following benefits:

1. Less hunger - this one is  fairly obvious, we still have the same amount of land utilized for producing food, but less people that need the food.
1. More space - The more people are born, the denser we have to build cities, this drives the price up and decreases quality of life, especially in poor areas where this leads to poverty, crime, etc. More space means better regional and urban land planning and better infrastructure.
1. Less pollution and global warming, and more time to reverse the existing pollution.
1. Better education - parents focus on one child instead of several, classes are smaller, which leads to personalized education.
1. Less alienation in society - big cities seem to negatively affect peoples mental health, the sense of community disappears, even though you live with more people, you interact with them less; less stress, less anxiety, less depression, less insanity.
1. Exponential population increases means an exponential use of limited resources, we are still very far from having unlimited sustainable renewable energy, factoring in this exponential increase we will reach the peak of natural resource production (oil/gas/coal) in the 2020's (according to hubberts peak theory).
1. More people dying than being born means they will leave their assets (land, house, cars, etc.), this will reduce prices.
1. Higher labor force + lower unemployment means better economy, means less working time, means better health, means less taxes to spend on sick people, less sick leaves. This also means better upbringing of children, as parents will have more money and time, and less stress, which means less crime, which again means better economy and less taxes (feedback loop).
1. Less wars (probably).
1. Less pregnant women, and time being pregnant, means a greater labor force. Also less kids means less stress and time wasted for the parents, which yet again means a greater labor force.

I could go on and on, but I think the point is rather clear. Every one of those arguments also works as a feedback loop for the others, i.e. (5.) leads to less mental health problems, which tangentially means every other point is also affected.

t3_8cvzv8	CMV: Holding the maximisation of economic growth as an immutable imperative of society will ultimately lead to humanity's downfall	"Humanity is currently faced with an ever-growing list of existential crises, the large majority of which are related either directly or indirectly to the rapid growth of the global economy and population. The sluggishness of humanity's response to many of these makes our chances of overcoming them slim in my view. 

While it can be argued that technology brings about new solutions (e.g. developments in new antibiotics, green energy, desalination), most of these are stop-gaps and not tackling the root cause of the issue (e.g. abuse of antibiotics in livestock herds across the world, energy companies like Shell stymieing adoption of solar power and climate research for decades, continued excessive use of fresh water for brewing alcohol, bottling soft drinks, and industry). 

Off my head I can currently think of:

* climate change
* growing antibiotic resistance in bacteria 
* the replacement of millions of hectares of lush rainforest with grazing land for a homogeneous population of livestock and all the accompanying piss and shit and gas they produce 
* deoxygenation of the ocean
* massive loss in biodiversity, both plant and animal
* falling population of pollenating insects
* catastrophic loss of coral reefs
* potential impending collapse of the West Antarctic ice sheet 
* ‎soil degradation and salination 
* widespread ‎loss of fresh water, both terrestrial and in aquifers 
* plastic pollution 
* industrial chemical pollution 
* potential release of methane clathrates stored in permafrost 
* ‎increased desertification
* ‎ and an ever-growing population on top of all this

I realise that a lot of these issues are interconnected by their nature, but I feel they all merit mentioning. 

Essentially I believe that this pattern of humanity achieving ""mastery"" over nature, only for it to repay us in unforseen circumstances further down the line will continue as long as we hold the maximisation of economic growth as one of the main societal drivers. I'm not an economist so the following statements are likely where I will most easily change my view, but it seems to me that any savings in the efficiency of industrial processes brought about by technological advancement are reinvested to grow the industry, and while that happens in an unrestrained manner humanity will continue to grow unsustainably. My example would be the growth of the solar panel industry, which of course is great for reducing CO2 emissions worldwide, but makes use of minerals that often come from unethical sources such as the Congolese rainforest and harm the environment in a different way, whilst failing to fully address the root cause of the problem which is the massive energy requirements of human civilisation. 

The alternative is not pleasant either, any kind of restructuring of society on this scale is like to be horrifying in the human cost. It would require those in the developed world to either ""pull the ladder up"" on the developing world which they plundered over the last few centuries, or for global wealth redistribution and the inevitable violence that would ensue. So please, CMV because it's a really miserable view to have.

t3_3sfvlv	"CMV:Assertions that ""a majority"" of scientists have a particular view undermines the nature of science and its role in understanding the world."	"

Situation A: A scientific consensus exists.  In this case, if appeals *must* be made to opinions of scientists (and there are usually or perhaps always better options than that) then appeals should only be made to ""the consensus"". Appeals to ""a majority"" understate the extent of scientific agreement, and also mislead laymen about the nature of scientific determinations, as described in the original post, below.

Situation B. A scientific consensus does not exist.  In this case, appeals to ""a majority"" of opinions of scientists is unhinged from any decision-making principle that the participating scientists would use for themselves.  It falsely implies to laymen that something similar to a consensus exists when it does not.  It also misleads laymen in the manner described above and below.

Many responses I have received have asserted that appeals to ""a majority"" of scientists is done exclusively to refer to a majority of the evidence, a majority of experiments, a literature review, meta-analysis or the like.  But this is not true and it is not what I'm referring to.  I am referring to, literally, [polls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveys_of_scientists%27_views_on_climate_change) of scientists' opinions.

Several posts have taken a sharper attack, asserting or at least pointing out the plausibility that the fact that ""a majority"" of scientists' opinions may *correlate with* the correctness of a fact (though it does not determine the fact).  Thus, even in the absence of consensus, knowing about the views of ""a majority"" seems to them marginally useful as compared to knowing that ""many"" scientists hold the opinion.  Or, to put it another way, knowing there is ""a majority"" is not I must concede this to probably be true -- although there has been no evidence presented to support it.  This has caused me to reconsider my post, its scope, and my underlying beliefs before making the post.  After this consideration, however, my view is unchanged.  My view as asserted does not depend on ""a majority"" being useless information.  Also, whenever I have seen appeals to ""a majority"" of scientific opinion, it has not been to persuade people to believe the proposition is marginally more likely to be true, but to persuade people that the debate on the matter should end.  Still, it requires me to refine my view slightly, because my view is clearer when I concede that it is not refuted by the small marginal utility.   

My view, now refined by this and a few other tweaks:  **Appeals to a poll showing ""a majority"" of scientists believe a certain proposition should not be used to persuade the public to accept that proposition as true, because the view of ""a majority"" of scientists, short of a consensus, of low marginal utility in assessing the truth, of zero utility in definitively determining the truth, and will meanwhile seriously confuse the public about the nature of scientific inquiry.  If there is a consensus, then there is no need to raise the opinions of ""a majority"", because the marginal utility of knowing about ""a majority"" is completely zero when ""a consensus"" is already known to exist, and the use of ""a majority"" is, again, deleterious to the public's understanding of the nature of scientific inquiry.**

I'll go award some deltas to those who participated in this refinement. 

**ORIGINAL POST:**

Frequently, with respect to climate change, but sometimes with respect to other issues, I see people (both scientists and non-scientists) assert that because ""a majority"" of scientists hold a particular view, that view is no longer ""open to debate"" and ought to simply be accepted and acted upon. 

I believe these assertions, however well meaning, ultimately do a disservice to the nature of scientific inquiry and its role in society.  It uses a political mechanism (majority vote) to describe a non-political phenomenon (scientific thought).  We all know intuitively that merely because a majority of people believe something, it does not make their belief correct.  Likewise, the fact that a majority of scientists believe something does not ensure that it is correct.  Therefore, appeals to what ""a majority"" of scientists think inherently undermines how science is perceived -- science becomes just one more ""opinion"". 

In contrast, saying things like ""the evidence for climate change is overwhelming"" or ""many scientific experiments have shown climate change is occurring"" or ""climate change can be easily demonstrated now in experiments"" are consistent with the nature of science, which is to be in an interrogatory with nature.   Replication, not peer review, is the gold standard for a successful experiment.   Science is a powerful force of understanding because it responds to the demand of ""show me"" rather than ""tell me"" which can be done in any other discipline.

I also am concerned that some laymen, without bothering to do their own experiments (or their direct reading of others' data) have come to adopt an attitude that they ""believe in"" ""science"" by which what they really mean is that they believe in ""scientists"" whose assertions they essentially accept on faith.  I see this as precariously similar to those who accept on faith the assertions of ministers or self-help gurus.   It is not, from the perspective of the faithful layman, evidence-based thinking.  

I feel that I could do a better job of explaining my view, but that's what I have for now.  Fundamentally, I think that assertions that ""a majority"" of scientists believe something is a cheap, invalid tactic and risks undermining the credibility of the scientific method.

Change my view!  (Or at least refine it...)  Thanks.

t3_3jwbxv	CMV: Earth is over-populated.	"**Definition:**  By over-populated, I mean that the human population is high enough that the average quality of life will suffer, relative to if we had a lower population.


**Why:** Almost every environmental problem we have is the result of overpopulation.  Climate change is caused by pollution, but pollution is caused by humans.  If there were only 1 million people on the planet, then each person could pollute 100 times as much as the average person does now and the Earth would still be in better condition.  And there's generally a connection between quality of life and amount of pollution you produce.  Lower population means everyone could live at a higher quality of life and still have humanity live sustainably.

Resource consumption is also an enormous problem.  Look at California right now; their lakes are [drying out at a ridiculous rate](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/Folsom-Lake-Water-Level-Dangerously-Low-as-Drought-Continues-324283981.html) and it's getting to the point where there isn't enough water to meet the state's agricultural and residential needs.  If there were just less people everywhere, then we wouldn't have to pump so much water out of our reservoirs and drain the lake as much.

Fisheries are another problem.  We tend to over-harvest them, and as a result decimate the population.  If we had smaller populations, each person could get as many fish as they want and still live sustainably.

Further, increased population limits the amount of finite resources (land, oil, etc.) that people can access and raises the prices of access to those resources.

Really the only benefit to higher population is that each person has more access to information products (movies, music, video games, etc.) but the marginal benefit of that in our lives is honestly so minimal at that point that it's well worth giving up in order to live in a world where we aren't creating massive environmental problems.

t3_8j1ug9	"CMV: The United States does not have a two-party system, it has a one-party system."	"Referring to my title, I mean to say that if you are a sane, educated person, you only have one large party to vote for: the Democratic party.

**I'm not arguing against the existence of two big parties, I'm arguing about the morality and validity of their policies.**
Let's look at some big issues and see where each party falls:

Abortion: Republicans fail pretty hard on this one. I can see how someone can view it as murder, but if we are talking about pragmatic policy, anti-abortion stances don't cut it in the real world. We've know for a while now that anti-abortion policies don't work, people will still get them and these policies do little to limit this.

Healthcare: The US lags behind the rest of the world on healthcare. Obamacare is not perfect but it is a step in the right direction. Republicans want to repeal it but couldn't come up with a replacement. They fail pretty hard on this issue.

Gun control: Again, the US lags behind the rest of the world on this. There is something to be said about gun culture and there are arguments on this but overall we are really stupid about guns in our country and the NRA has heavily bought out conservative politicians.

Climate change: Republicans time and time again align themselves against science and embarrass themselves when it comes to this issue.

Education: Need I say more.

Welfare: The US lags behind, again, everyone else. Supply-side economics and its various hydra heads have been slain by every leading economist since Reagan. We know that giving the rich tax cuts doesn't work. Republicans have failed their constituents by repeatedly passing policy that they continue to benefit from, leaving the rest of us out to dry.

War: Both parties in the US are extremely warlike, but conservatives moreso. I can't knock them much on this because dems can be stupid when it comes to foreign policy too.

~~Immigration: This goes without saying. Leading economists agree that immigration is good for the economy and that these often cited ""ill effects"" are fantasies. Republicans repeatedly fumble on immigration. Come on... a fucking wall?~~

Drugs: Not even going to waste my time on this one. Dems get the point of course.

Civil rights: ^

Prison reform: Clinton did continue the shit prison reform of previous republican presidents, but the modern parties are split on this issue. Republicans are involved in a toxic for-profit prison system that directly benefits them. Dems are the only possible way that this will be solved.

I could continue but this is the trend I'm trying to establish. What I'm not arguing is that the dems are perfect and loving politicians who always do the right thing, I'm arguing that they are the lesser of two evils. If any party is going to make positive change then the Dems will be our best shot.

**What won't convince me:**

Uncited rebuts of my points. Just saying that I'm wrong on any of these issues with proper citation won't cut it. I've done lots of research on these topics and I'm parroting every scientist and leading economist. Just stating that ""immigration is bad"" won't cut it, because every source has said otherwise. For example, just stating the fact that dems have not perfectly executed their strategy for helping poor black people is not a rebuttal. They are the only party trying. Just because the dems aren't perfect, doesn't mean that voting for repubs magically makes sense. Hence my title: The US has a one party system.

Bringing up other points is fine, but these are the linchpin issues I've brought up. A single point being disproven/brought up that contradicts my point won't cut it. I'm talking in generalities. I'm talking about who should get the vote. I need to be convinced that Republicans have the better overall policy.

~~Philosophy is not what we are discussing. Conservationism has some merit intellectually but we are talking about politics and hence, policy. I don't care about the philosophical implications of this or that, I care about saving lives and doing the right thing, the correct thing based on research on statistics. Again, dems don't do everything perfectly but they aren't a joke like the republican party.~~"	1	
t3_4c7lkt	"CMV: There is a logical reason to consume meat, dairy, or eggs"	"Almost all meat is not as healthy as it's plant-based counterparts. Per calorie, many vegetables have more protein than most meats. 
There have been many studies rejecting the nutritional value of dairy.
Animal agriculture is the leading cause in deforestation, and is responsible for more harmful greenhouse gasses than the entire auto industry. 
Over fishing is destroying our oceans and reefs and the fish industry, especially tuna, is notorious for human trafficking and rights violations.
In general, farmers who work for big meat corporations like Tyson and Purdue are also treated horribly. 
And lastly, though this may be a personal opinion, the meat industry is known for horrible treatment and animal abuse not only in rare cases, but on a regular basis.

So yeah, I see no logical reason for people to continue eating meat, when it has only caused destruction to the lives of humans, animals and the environment.

t3_93y88b	CMV: I believe in determinism and that free will doesn't exist	"I was reading ""The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People"", from Stephen Covey, and there was a part of the book about behaviorism. It stated that with proactivity and responsability we can obtain free will, while those who are reactive are doomed to be slaves of external stimuli. I tried to be open minded, but it was difficult because I disagreed with every sentence.

One of the paragraphs commented that we, as humans, are the only self conscious beings in the Earth, which allowed us to know our habits and also change them. Stephen Covey explains that being able to modify our habits is what differentiate us from animals and grant us free will. But see, that's plainly wrong. In computing there is a concept called metaprogramming, which consist on programs that are able to modify themselve. Being able to modify our conduct doesn't mean that we have free will, we could have being designed to experience said change from the beginning. 

I think that in the universe every event has a cause and we are no exception. Why should we? Humans like to distinguish themselves from what surrounds them, while forgetting that we are nothing but the result of it. 

Every time someone watchs the news to find out a murderer has killed people, or a pederast has raped a kid, you can see how they project their rage against the offender. People think that those people deserve so much pain for the pain they have caused, while not considering that the reason of their acts is probably the pain they have already suffered. It's like the sociaty lives in a fantasy world, with the difference that there's no hero and only villains. But I don't believe in villains. I don't think people chooses to be evil. We shouldn't focus our fury in those persons, but the environment they lived their childhood in.

I would like to point out that I don't believe behaviour is determined only by the environment, but the conbination of environment and genetics. 

To my eyes, we are nothing but complex biomechanic machines, programmed to act in one way or another. We live in a costant illusion of free will. If there was to exist an omniscient being, It would not only know all that happened, but all that is to happen, as future is already defined. Every event is predictable, included our actions. 

I would really like to see what others think about this, and it would be even better if someone gets to change my mind and add more meaning to our existance and acts. 

So go on, change my view!"	1

I hate to say it, but I don't think we have another century left. Please tell me why I'm wrong.

t3_ep3b0m	"CMV: Algae-based biofuels would reduce carbon emissions so much that it's worth the moral hazards they entail, and so working for companies that enable them."	"I am a statistics graduate student trying to make a career decision (and imminent class decisions!). I’m finding it difficult to find answers for my dilemma, since each party to the dispute have strong, interlocking and complicated reasons to defend their side. Each side doesn't engage much with the arguments and evidence of the other side because, best I can tell, their reasons take this interlocking form. 

I’d like to devote my career to climate solutions and have some training in computational biology. I could work on cultured meats and flora-based milks, but replacing fossil fuels is the big one. 

First the pros. Despite the serious and diverse moral hazards, it seems some kind of large-scale carbon capture will be necessary (or at least prudent to prepare for). Moreover, deep decarbonization requires finding temporary solutions for plastics and the sunk energy costs of most vehicles in operation today ASAP until we find alternatives. Algae-based biofuels, if feasible, seem like solutions to both of these: “High rates of biomass productivity and lipid content are shown by this microalgae genus [Nannochloropsis gaditana] (300 mg/L/day and 45%, respectively)”  (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096014811831259X) David Mackay (who’s great), based on numbers from Ron Putt of Auburn University (don’t know him), calculated that algae could produce power per unit pond area of 4 W/m2 (similar to low-yield solar farms in Germany) (https://www.withouthotair.com/cD/page_285.shtml). Biofuels are dirty but carbon-neutral transitional replacements for fossil fuels in our present economy. They could be rolled out very fast by the capital currently in energy companies--which they will have incentive to do, if not by carbon-pricing, then by depleted reserves or divestment. Even the marine algae species will probably strain water reserves, but this seems less bad than the environmental degradation of the vast mining necessary to build solar panels, transmission lines, and batteries.

So is it feasible? No, but feasibility studies suggest that increasing lipid yields (oily stuff) are the biggest hurdle, and there has been serious recent progress. (https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3865) In addition, developments in genetic sequencing and engineering make me believe more breakthroughs are on the near-term horizon. (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0703-5) (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0392-0) 
That’s the space I think I could work in.

Now the cons. Energy companies are the biggest reason we are in this mess. Some of that was before they knew carbon dioxide caused climate change, but most of it was after they knew and worked not only to protect themselves, but also endanger all of us by interfering with the scientific consensus. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ExxonMobil_climate_change_controversy)
I wouldn’t be surprised if these companies have committed more ecological and humanitarian crimes than any others. I don’t think they can be trusted, and giving them technology to dominate the next era of energy makes me sick. Second, there is the moral hazard that all carbon capture entails: it allows us to delay making a clean energy transition. (https://science.sciencemag.org/content/354/6309/182) And although algae-based biofuels aren’t as (morally) hazardous as geoengineering, they are plenty bad: it may promote BECCS and the lethal pollution and ecological degradation that goes with it.

Conclusion:
And yet, I worry the disasters of not deploying feasible biofuel technology, both ecological and humanitarian, would be greater than those created by them. Priority goes to electricity generation, but at some point of marginal utility, I do think it’s worth investing in biofuel R&D. I’m not sure the accounting is right, but consider that the transition from coal to methane (natural gas) seems to be have been greatest reducer (not eliminator!) of carbon emissions in the US to date.  And I don’t see an alternative right now to working for these companies, directly or indirectly, if I work in computational biology and I’m serious about the greatest possible impact on climate change."	1	
t3_808f7e	CMV: worldwide nuclear disarmament would increase the risk of a nuclear attack	"If tomorrow, every country agreed, in good faith, to shut down all nuclear warfare programs and decommission their warheads, I believe the world would instantly become a much more dangerous place and the likelihood of a nuclear attack at some point in the future would increase.

The chance of an attack happening the next day, would of course, fall to zero - however in the medium to long term I believe it would increase because of the removal of the disincentive to create a nuclear bomb.  The pro nuclear bomb argument usually focusses on a particular country needing to have weapons because others already have them, so disarming would increase the likelihood of you being attacked - the argument goes that you don't disarm because it's unrealistic to think others would do the same.

However, in a hypothetical situation where the USA, Britain, Saudi Arabia, Russia and everyone else all genuinely agreed to disarm at exactly the same time, it wouldn't be possible to remove the knowledge of how to create a nuclear bomb.  This would lead to a situation where any change in sentiment from a country (likely from a change in political power) would mean they'd potentially have a free run to build a bomb and drop it on an enemy nation without threat of retaliation.  

That considered, I'd suggest the likelihood of a nuclear bomb being dropped would massively increase.  The deterrent we have at the moment would not exist for any State trying to arm itself and the motivation to create a bomb for evil people would be massive.

I'd love it if a nuclear bomb free world was a safer one, so please change my view :)

t3_3c8fiu	"CMV: A carbon tax and a wealth tax would be more rational than income, payroll, capital gains and sales taxes"	"Let's assume that we will never reach consensus on the reality of AGW. We do know, however, that oil and coal are non-renewable resources. It is therefore wise to preserve them for our children. Fossil fuels are also direct pollutants by way of ocean acidification and particulate matter.

A carbon tax would encourage conservation of a limited resource, and discourage pollution. Just in case AGW is real, we would also have hedged our bets there.
 
A wealth tax is equally virtuous because it discourages the pooling of money and encourages it to be pumped through the economy. It whittles away at inheritance and encourages investment (you need your investments to ""outrun"" the wealth tax).

Conversely, income, payroll, capital gains and sales taxes all act as brakes on the economy. All of them ""punish"" things we want people to do: make money, get paid, invest money and buy things.

For example, in the economy I describe, a small time musician would see virtually no taxes except those embedded in the fossil-fuel-based products that she buys. She would pay no income tax or sales tax. Once she went on tour and started using significant amounts of electricity on lights and sound, the event organizers would have to build those costs into the ticket prices. This means that the tour might be a bit smaller and a bit less coal might be burned. This might save the life of an asthmatic or old person.[1]

If she became a ballionaire, then she could ""give back"" to the community through the wealth tax. This seems a lot more sane than taxing her every which way from day 1.

Where is the flaw in my logic?

t3_88gskm	CMV: Better to destroy humanity instead of another human ending up in hell	"Change my view:  It is better that all of humanity be destroyed entirely, rather than another human being end up in eternal torment.

Base assumption:  Pre-existence is not real, and the choice to procreate is what introduces a conscious, self-aware life into this reality in this universe.  

Base assumption 2: Hell is a real consequence for some non-zero subset of humans who have not yet been born.

Base assumption 3: Destroying all of humanity will actually prevent any further humans who have not yet been born from ending up in eternal torment.

Mathematically, the impact of infinite torture upon even ONE human is far greater than all of the suffering that will ever have occurred in the most horrific of ways for all of humanity in this universe, and will occur.  Therefore, the impact of one human ending up in a form of hell (technological, spiritually induced, or however) is significant enough that, if real, and if any humans not yet born would end up in hell, that it's far better that we destroy all of humanity.

Reddit, you're being visited by aliens.  DNA capture by aliens who force procreation of human entities into a technological hell is a non-zero probability, and one that is possibly certain in the context of the multiverse.

t3_90y6r4	CMV:nuclear power is the best source of energy right now	"Here me out. Coal produces tons of carbon dioxide, destroying the ozone layer, and according to the general book of ignorance, produces 100 times more radiation than nuclear. Renewable sources, as of now, most of them produce more carbon dioxide than nuclear does and on average kill more people than nuclear. Compare all this to nuclear, which although it has a reputation for being dangerous due to incidents like Chernobyl, are actually pretty safe. Your chance of contacting illness from one is currently one in a billion. People often use the fact that nuclear power furthers nuclear weapons research, but a new type of reactor uses thorium instead of uranium and plutonium. Thorium cannot be used in nuclear weapons, as well as being more plentiful than uranium and having a lower half life in terms of toxic waste. Nuclear power also produces no carbon dioxide. Although it’s not renewable and we may eventually run out of uranium, plutonium and thorium, it takes very little of those sources to produce lots of energy. This is why I think nuclear is the way forward until a new source of energy is created.

t3_1xduqg	"I think humanity is virtually guaranteed to overcome the apparent limitations of the laws of physics, and prevent an end of the universe or life as we know it. CMV"	"My viewpoint stems from the fact that I think hard observational sciences should not be our entire basis for the study of the future. It makes complete sense for physicists to conclude, based on the data in their field, that it is impossible to create a perpetual motion machine, prevent eventual proton decay, travel faster than light, etc., because they are studying what we observe, in the here and now, and how to apply it to immediate efforts and goals.

To carry this methodology of observational science into futurology is, in my opinion, misguided, essentially because we cannot observe the future from where we're standing. Our perspective is very very limited. The amount of data we have about the moon is orders of magnitude less than the amount we have about the Earth - and even on Earth, the amount of data we have about the depths of the ocean is orders of magnitude less than what we have about the ground we walk on. Go further than the moon, and you continue to see an exponential decline in how much we can really see.

Our data is simply biased to our perspective, it's as simple as that. Observational science needs to adhere to our perspective, even though our perspective may not line up with reality, because it needs to be applied in a way that it could not be if it relied on things we don't know the specifics of. Studies of the future should not work this way, they should attempt to line up with reality even if it means losing a great deal of specificity. So studies of the future should not use our extremely human-perception-centered ideas of how the universe works as the basis for prediction. When you think about the real amount of data that we simply don't have, it seems ridiculous to assume that everything works exactly the same way as what we've seen so far.

Our track record shows us that we constantly disprove what we think to be the limitations of the world around us. We know that we can only observe so much - for all we know, there's a type of particle or field that we have no idea about because it doesn't interact with any of the particles or fields that we do know of, maybe *because* it doesn't follow the same laws of physics. Maybe there's some material that exists on some foreign planet a million light-years away, just one little fluke so rare and so distant that we've never encountered it in our observations, and it just keeps on expanding in mass for no discernible reason. There are countless possibilities, perfectly reasonable and even notably logical explanations, of things that go against what we ""know,"" because what we know is so limited. AND, we know that it is in our nature to find these things eventually, the pieces of information that let us break the previous rules. So it makes sense to assume that we will eventually do so.

**TL;DR** - Observational ""hard science"" doesn't work in predicting the future, because the human race is a collective toddler and we haven't observed the future. Our track record shows us that we usually end up being wrong, and there are very good examples of how we might be wrong in this case. Why turn to the consensus of physicists, whose goal is something entirely different, when trying to predict the future? How is the evidence that we *won't* overcome the limitations of known science greater than the evidence that we *will*?"	1

 I also know that there are some people that weren't born in the situation like I am. They didn't ask for it but they're calamities of  others people wrong doing


TLDR. Basically, I'm contradicting myself. I see that there is good in the world but not knowing of others people lives and how the world is bad ok no there POV, leaves me in a neutral situation.

Change my view!!!

t3_6cucfk	CMV: Evidence is the only thing that should be allowed steer policy. It should be regarded as absolutely holy and should supercede any other forces dictating the architecture of our society.	"I have always wondered how it is that anything apart from reason, logic and evidence has survived political debate. If one has reproducable, transparent evidence of some policy innovation leading to a decrease in suffering or an increase of human welbeing, how can one lose any debate that scores reason and scientific substantiation? 
When presenting evidence and demanding evidence of the claims of the opposing party, one has instantly won when the opposing group lacks substantiation or am I missing something. How do we still allow disproven nonsense, guessing, unprovable supernatural beliefs and other things for which there simply cannot be any evidence provided, affect our society?

In a free society, I would think it vital to allow everyone their personal freedom as long as it doesn't affect others. But with something like the anti-vaxxing movement, society can't just accept their unsubstantiated claims affecting innoscent people. After presenting all the evidence and completing the debate of reason, these people have got to be, in the most friendly and civil ways possible, stripped of their capacity to hurt society, right? 
Same story with religious or ideological extremism, including materialism.

Reason should prevail always, and the reasonable should claim/ have the right to suppress everything unreasonable when it comes to public policy.

Please change my maybe naive view.

t3_2l42m0	"CMV: I believe that voluntary vegetarianism and veganism, other than that for religious reasons, is a product of living in the developed world"	"In the developed world, we have a choice as to whether we eat meat. Along with this, we can have many other luxuries not normally afforded to people living in less fortunate conditions. For those living in poverty, eating meat is very often not a choice; it is a necessity. Throughout human history, meat has been a staple of many diets, often obtained through hunting, and later through farming. There have been, and still are, times and places where meat is scarce or a luxury, but not that this is not *voluntary* abstinence from consuming meat. A voluntary abstinence from eating meat, for *secular* and *ethical* reasons is only attainable, and is indeed a product of, life in the developed world. 

Only in the developed world do factory farming and slaughterhouses exist on such a massive scale to meet huge consumer demand. Such a problem would not exist if eating meat were a luxury or on a smaller scale, as it is in poorer societies, or as it was in other points in history. However, because of large consumer demand, meat must be farmed and slaughtered on a large scale. 

Thus, an *ethical* and *secular* objection to eating meat can only exist in the first world due to a choice as to whether we eat meat, and the way meat is produced.

t3_8x322i	CMV: Capitalism is unsustainable and flawed	"My views are based off of one assumption, capitalism causes companies to be as profitable as possible. This means that companies are against anything that causes them loss in profits, and pro anything goes that allows them to increase profits. This can be at the cost of the political climate, the actual climate, people, and the globe. First biased reporting and echo chambers are profitable even though it is damaging to the political climate. Being green may be profitable, but not as profitable as pretending you are. Changing production, recipes and such is highly expensive. During the Great Depression many workers were paid less than living wage simply because it was profitable for companies to do so, even though it was detrimental to their workers, the amount of competition allowed them to do so. Lastly the globe. The military industrial complex and containment caused rise to dictators in Indonesia, the Middle East, and caused us to support one in Vietnam. Funding conflicts around the world is very morally reprehensible as war is bad, but it was profitable to arms dealers so conflict was supported. Capitalism does work when regulated, but regulation restricts profits so, capitalism is anti regulation. Many claim that it has caused massive advancement in technology, these developments are a byproduct of profit and is much more inefficient than actually focusing on scientific development. To sum it up capitalism is for profit, and because of this anti everything else."	1	
t3_92x0oi	CMV: The government should more expend more money towards environmental protection.	"I think the environment is greatly overlooked despite it being essential to all of us. A clean and healthy environment necessary for a healthy life. The government only spends about 1.17% of its total federal spending towards energy and environment. That money isn't even completely directed towards environmental protection meaning the amount is even less.  I ran into a frightening statistic the other day that 47% of Americans live in areas that often have unhealthy amounts of pollutant in the air (State of the air). That's up by 5% from when the study was conducted. Of course if the government where to expend more money towards environmental protection, money from other areas would have to be less funded. I believe it is a worthy trade off.

t3_1yzzx8	A government who cuts welfare but reserves £15-£20 Billion for a renewed nuclear missile system is fundamentally wrong. CMV	"In the UK, our nuclear missile system needs renewing if we are to keep our nuclear status. Yet, it hasn't sunk into our government that cutting welfare but keeping a huge amount of money back for it is for nothing more but dickswinging on the world stage and is failing our citizens. Sure, we keep our place on the UN security council, but so the fuck what? Why should we, a middle ranking European country, have any say because we have the biggest stick? There are plenty more countries that could do a better job, and it would make one more democratic seat on what should be a council that avoids war.

The estimated cost of Trident will be between 15 and 20 billion pounds for a small fleet of submarines. Let that sink in a little and perhaps Google what you can buy for 15-20 billion. It's a huge amount of money for something that if we use, we fail as the human race. If nuclear missiles are to be used, what then? We are all fucked, and all at the cost of the taxpayer. We aren't even a big enough/powerful enough country for it to matter. [Just look at this graph, we are small fries compared to bigger countries](http://news.bbcimg.co.uk/media/images/59306000/gif/_59306324_nuclear_weapons_464.gif).

And for those who say that nuclear weapons keep us safe, it is a ridiculous statement. North Korea, as Cameron used as a weak excuse, is not going to happen, not yet anyway. Besides, if they decided to strike us, it's useless, all we end up doing is retaliate and still end up with a scorched nation. There's more traction in using the money for nuclear defence capabilities- the ability to intercept missiles and destroy them, rather than mass retaliation.

15-20 billion could be put back into the economy or at least used partly to negate the debt that our government love to remind us that we are in. It could be used in public sectors that sorely need money pumped in, and be used for good rather than a weapon that is fundamentally evil and detrimental to the human race. We also lead the way as the first country to disarm entirely on a voluntary basis. Even if nobody followed, we can stand proud as a nation who overcame evil on our own accord.

Nuclear weapons should be a thing of the past, and they won't be until somebody makes a move. It could have been us, and we could have saved a shit ton of public money in the meantime. Sadly, our government wanted to continue the pissing contest.


1) People seem to be stuck in the Cold War mentality, when we live in an age where nuclear saber-rattling is largely obsolete. Wars against nations are also more defunct than ever, as our main enemies as of now are non governmental and paramilitary. But when they do occur, it leads to my next point:

2) People cite countries that don't have nuclear weapons and how they are at the mercy of nations that do. This is a load of crap. Nations that have been invaded by nuclear powers have clear disadvantages away from nuclear 'deterrents'. Chiefly, corrupt/irresponsible governments, inadequate armed forces, and numerical/technological inferiority. All you have to do is look at the many other nations that are not nuclear powers and how they have not been invaded. Look at the rest of Europe: Scandinavia, Germany, Belgium, Holland, Italy, Greece- have they been invaded despite no nuclear arms? NO- so why would it possibly be different for us? Which imaginary army have you got in your mind that is going to rock up on the British coast and invade? Besides, the odds of having a non-nuclear state invading is statistically more likely.

3) It keeps people in jobs- yes, that's true, but again, think how much good 15-20 billion would do. It would create more jobs many times over- the defence industry may employ a base of people- but it is still a small number compared to what you could create with the money.

4) It's not an investment in the slightest- if we use Trident, we have failed at humanity. It is wasted money if we don't use it. Either way, we lose, so why bother?"	1	
t3_65kblo	CMV: Most people who vigorously support the Republican Party are either selfish or ignorant (or both).	"Let me clarify my viewpoint. By ""most"" I mean at least two-thirds and by ""vigorously"" I mean people who consistently vote for Republicans. By ""selfish"" I mean lacking consideration for people one does not know intimately and concerned mainly with one's own personal profit or pleasure. By ""ignorant"" I mean lacking knowledge or awareness of basic facts of the world, especially the basic facts of science (e.g., evolution and global warming) and the facts about public policies (e.g., the difference between the deficit and debt, what policies Republicans and Democrats are proposing, history of social policy).

The selfishness is revealed by the fact that Republicans consistently exhibit substantially lower levels of empathy than non-Republicans. This is also reflected in surveys of the general population: https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/romney-has-an-empathy-problem-but-so-do-most-republicans/

The ignorance is indicated by the numerous surveys showing that Republicans tend to be less educated and more unaware of basic facts of the world than non-Republicans. For example, see: http://2012election.procon.org/sourcefiles/low-effort-thought-promotes-political-conservatism-2012.pdf

t3_1x4e9l	"Evolution has a goal, and that goal is humanity. CMV"	"To rephrase it in a more robust way, if an evolutionary process were ran multiple times, a species that looks and acts very similar to us would result.

Evolution is a process where populations adapt to their environment through random mutations altering fitness for that environment and thereby increasing the frequency of those more fit genes in a gene pool. However, underneath this basic description larger trends exist. The *existence* of more complex organisms inevitably results. These organisms have more complex genetic code, and thus a larger mutation/interaction surface that allows greater chances for beneficial mutations to occur. [Thus complexity itself can itself be adaptive.](https://www.google.com/search?q=evolution+of+evolvability)

Evolution is a process of enhancing survival. Reproduction is the mechanism of survival and adaptation is the mechanism of enhancement. That is, until a species becomes intelligent enough to manipulate its environment to such a degree that it can secure its own survival. This is where humans come in to the picture. We have the right combination of physical features and mental capacity to enable us to manipulate the environment. We're at the point where we can overcome diseases and survive in almost all environments found on earth. Eventually we will get to the point where we can survive all possible environmental threats (virus, comets, death of the sun). This is essentially ""winning"" at evolution. 

We haven't gotten to the point where we can survive all manner of environmental threats, but if our descendants do, they will be physically indistinguishable from us today. Evolution still operates on us, and will continue to do so. But we today will not be fundamentally different from our supposed galaxy faring descendants. A scientist from such a future would classify us today as being of the same species.

I believe that the process of evolution is essentially a random walk through the space of possible phenotypes (gene expressions) until one reaches us, where further movement essentially stops. We have the most efficient number of limbs: two legs for optimally efficient movement, two arms with hands to grip and opposable thumbs for optimal manipulation of the environment. Mouths, tongues and vocal chords to articulate complex sounds to support maximally efficient communication. Nearly optimally efficient brains to understand language, to understand the environment and to manipulate it with purpose. If we found intelligent life on another planet, it would necessarily look like us.

Evolution by natural selection is a process of optimizing reproduction, and evolution cannot possibly do any better.

t3_c8qg6h	CMV: The government should start to gradually enforce dietary regulations for the sake of the environment.	"Lately i've been thinking alot about the climate, reading studies, listening to debates and also chatting with Friends. Seeing that there is No debate that our way of eating is detremental to the environment and change is sermingly not Quick enough. Should the government start to gradually regulate the production of foods down to necessary levels?

This gradual change would in My mind be affecting meat and dairy the heaviest, ofcourse some bad vegetarian or vegan options should also be regulated in this case. 

I wan't to add that i am a vegetarian working towards becoming vegan, this process is difficult for me since i have celiac disease and alot of vegan options were i live i simply cant eat. I understand how dietary changes can be difficult and scary, i have respect for People who say they find it Hard to change their diets. Habits and different obstacles are Hard to get past. My point being that, IF the government were to lend a hand in going greener gradually then this change might be easier since you wont be alone.

I also study industrial economics (aka engineer here in Sweden), wich means i am well aware of the economical and sometimes ethical implications of governmental regulations. IF you have any input on the economical / ethical side of this then please feel free to add that!

t3_ho184z	CMV: There is no empirical support for the Cancel Culture panic	"It has become dogma among pundits and regular people on both sides of the political spectrum that “Cancel Culture” is a new and grave threat to society. The claim is that debate has become less open in general and that free speech is under attack because of the Cancel mob.

With the rise of social media amplifying more voices with every passing day, I can totally understand how people have come to this conclusion. What I don’t see is any empirical support for the notion that debate is less open or speech is less free. It is especially strange to see that the panic around it is perhaps most acute among the same people who regularly talk about how we need to return to facts and logic rather than feelings in the discourse. 

How are we measuring the “openness” of debate? If we claim it is less open, when was it more open? Is there any proof that “cancellation” didn’t happen then? Basically- Is there any evidence beyond feelings and platitudes that speech is actually less free now than in the past? 

I haven’t seen good answers to any of these questions, but I fully acknowledge it’s possible that they exist and I simply haven’t found them. So my challenge to the subreddit is to show me that evidence, and give me some indication beyond examples and vibes that modern “cancel culture” actually represents something new and threatening."	1	
t3_777ajp	CMV:Politicians should not be allowed to make decisions outside the scope of their expertise; experts should define policy based on modern science	"In society today we see a huge disparity towards how governments behave with regards to important issues such as environment, economics, and education (etc.) compared with how modern scientists believe governments behave. Policy rarely mirrors scientific evidence fully. Instead, politicians, who almost always lack expertise in subject their offices deal with, are given free reign make disastrous, harmful policies, often due to political or economic greed. There is evidence of this everywhere. One only needs to look at how big countries deal with climate change to see the clear disregard of science by politicians.

Why should a career politician without knowledge of fisheries science decide catch quotas? Yes, the short term jobs within the industry may suffer but by ignoring scientific evidence you’re far more likely to cause long term damage to the industry affecting far more lives and damaging the ecosystem far more than if you were to uphold quotas correctly.

Why should a career politician without knowledge (or $willful$ ignorance of knowledge) of climate science be allowed to determine carbon emission budgets?

Why should upper-class, private school educated politicians decide how the school system should be run for working class kids in inner city schools?

Why should old men decide what women can do with their bodies?

Yes, I’m some what describing technocracy, although I do not think it should be total technocracy. Politicians have some place but I think they shouldn’t run the show completely. Decisions should be made by experts and not just at the advice of experts, as it’s clear as day that politicians are far too willing to ignore expertise in favour of personal gain.

t3_6r3650	CMV: There is no excuse for eating meat if you live in a country or city where vegetarian food i widely available.	"I stopped eating meat completely approximately one year ago. During that time, when exploring vegetarian food and the consequences of meat eating I have been convinced that consuming meat products is objectively selfish and irresponsible. I'll try outlining my arguments as well as answer some potential counter-arguments. While I do not see myself ever eating meat again, I am open to changing my view that it is inexcusable and selfish.

My arguments, ordered from what I consider least to most important:

**Health**
Eating meat is strongly connected with negative health effects, they often contain large amounts of saturated fats and LDL cholesterol which increase risk of heart disease. Red meats in particular are also linked with cancer risk.

While this is certainly an argument for switching off meat, I do not consider it as important; mainly for two reasons:

1. Not eating meat does not somehow guarantee a healthy diet, your meals still need to be well-balanced and healthy. Candy, chips and pastries might not contain an animal's muscles, but it's not very healthy.

2. While there are several health risks linked with meat, these only affect the person eating, and I believe that choice to be entirely up to them.

[Source](http://www.webmd.com/food-recipes/features/the-truth-about-red-meat#1)

**Ethical**
Industrial farming is horrible for animals, information is widely available about these conditions.

**Environmental**
Land requirements (and thus destruction of forests), water requirements, fossil fuel use, methane gas production and other negative environmental effects are much massively worse for meat production compared to vegetables. These factors all lead to health risks, pollution, contribute to climate change and the destruction of ecosystems and habitats. 

This I consider to be most important because despite if you do not care about the well-being of yourself or the animals, consuming meat is still polluting and destroying the planet we all share and for all future generations. 

[Source](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/78/3/664S.full)

Counter-arguments

**Eating vegetarian is more expensive**

Lentils, soybeans, tempeh etc are the most inexpensive proteins you can find. Along with carbs such as rice and potatoes as well as fresh vegetables and fruits (which you need in a meat-based diet as well), eating vegetarian is way cheaper than eating meat (one of the reasons I stopped eating meat at first, I could not afford it).

**Humans are carnivorous and have always eaten meat**
Since there is no evidence that humans *need* to eat meat to be healthy and happy, this is basically a non-argument. Do you agree with slavery or child marriage, since these are things we have ""always done""?

**You have no right to decide what I can and cannot do!**
You require resources to survive, these take effort to produce and process and have effects on the world, you do not exist in a vacuum. Eating meat affects all of us negatively whether you like it or not.

**By the same logic, you cannot have a car, buy clothes or anything else that might have negative effects on the world.**
While I am a strong proponent of public transport or walking/bicycling and only buying what you truly need, I do not consider these the same questions. While having a car, for example, makes your life easier and opens up several opportunities, I see being a vegetarian as not more expensive or more difficult than eating meat, and therefore doing so is merely selfish and irresponsible. 

I have probably missed something and I am ready to discuss this question, I apologize for any grammatical or spelling mistakes.

t3_3ce8i4	CMV: We should really be eating less meat	"I decided to write this here because it's hard to have this discussion anywhere on reddit without getting low effort, kneejerk responses like: ""found the vegan"" and ""for whatever animal you don't eat, I'll eat three!"" If you're going to write that type of response... please don't. 


I'll also preface this by saying that I've been a vegetarian for more than a decade. I know how off putting a preachy vegetarian can be as I know a few (in my experience the preachiest ones are usually the ones that have been vegetarian for a short amount of time or the ones that take to veganism with a religious fervour), but I will be respectful and hope my arguments are judged only on their merits. To start off: 


1. I don't judge meat eaters or push people to stop eating meat altogether, but I am open to discussing vegetarianism with people who ask. 

2. I don't expect the entire world to stop eating meat, all I'm asking is that we cut back (a lot). 

3. I think there are situations where it is okay to eat meat, such as subsistence hunting/farming. 


My responses to popular arguments I often hear *for* eating meat:


**Appeals to Nature**


1. Humans are omnivores; we evolved to eat meat. We need meat to live. 


**Response**: Being an omnivore doesn't mean one has to eat meat. We are capable of surviving on a large variety of diets, some of which contain meat, others do not. The important thing is being able to meet our nutrient and vitamin requirements. In the developed world we have access to such a wide variety of foods that it is completely reasonable to be a survive on a vegetarian diet with minimal effort (and scientists agree). A vegan diet is also possible, though this diet requires more foresight and planning.


2. We are at the top of the food chain, therefore we should eat meat.


**Response**: I also have a driver's licence but that doesn't mean I *have to* drive. I would also argue that those of us living in the developed world *are not really part of the food chain* as not only does our existence not hinge on the whims of the natural world in our immediate vicinity in any way, through technology we are completely removed from whatever ecosystems we live in to the extent where we can be just fine without having to know the first thing about survival in the wild. The majority of humans in the developed world have never hunted or fished nor do they even know how to exist in the natural world without leveraging technologies to soften the impact of doing so. We also have zero predators or prey in any of our human controlled environments unless we willingly remove ourselves from these environments to go and looking for them.


Also we have an opposable thumb, the capacity for abstract thought, and therefore the ability to shape the world around us. That gives us an unfair advantage over every other species on the planet. 


3. The Circle of Life (animals are jerks and kill each other all the time--why shouldn't we join in?) 


**Response**: Because we're too good at it. Other sentient beings don't have the power to raise entire species in captivity and harvest them over and over again once the meat is *just right* for selling/eating ad infinitum. I think the fact that we're capable of making tools at a scale where we can basically sculpt our environments to our liking and removes ourselves from nature to the point where we can lead abstract existences that are incomphrensible to any species living on this planet comes with some responsibilities, like that we should avoid dispensing suffering upon any form of sentient life when possible and we shouldn't shit where we eat, ie: wreck the planet to the point where we can't live here anymore.

4. Vegetarians/vegans indirectly kill animals anyway, it's unavoidable

**Response**: Yes, that stupid Maddox argument has been sent to me a dozen times between 1998 and now. It is true that vegans/vegetarians are indirectly responsible for the deaths of animals, particularly vegetarians as we still eat some animal products. Does that make the diet not worth doing? Hell no! My meat consumption is extremely low as the only meat I eat is accidental. I don't believe it's possible to completely avoid the suffering of animals, but I do seek to minimize it as much as is possible. 

People get too hung up on the titles ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"". It's better to see them more as goals we should strive for or standards we should hold ourselves to, not a binary state like ""believer"" or ""nonbeliever"" that we need to cling to. 


Arguments for reducing meat consumption



**Environmental** 


Livestock cultivation is a huge contributor to greenhouse gases which is increasing as economies like China and India develop and the demand for meat in those countries increases. I believe livestock cultivation accounts for between 12-15% of greenhouse gases (of a total of %18 for agriculture), which is more than transportation. Also, cow farts (seriously) and animals that rechew regurgitated food are responsible for releasing two billion tonnes of methane (a greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere each year, which is being accelerated by rainforest deforestation to make way for more grazing land.


**Ethical**


I actually don't have a problem with subsistence hunting. I'd much rather people hunted their meat than went to the supermarket, though I recognize how impractical this would be at scale with 6 billion humans on the planet. 


Factory farming causes a huge amount of animal suffering, there is really no silver lining or any way to sugar coat it. Some operations are better than others and there are some farmers that treat their animals well (as has been shown on reddit frequently), however these tend to be the exception to the lowest bidder norm, especially outside of North America where vegetarian/vegan initiatives or ""free range"" or ""organic"" movements haven't taken root yet. Here in Korea and other parts of Asia, there aren't even any animal rights laws (absolutely zero--someone could murder a stray animal and nothing would come of it).


All one needs to do is spend a few hours on YouTube looking at footage obtained from factory farming operations to appreciate the true impact that it is having. That's without getting into the inherent dangers of factory farms as breeding grounds for super viruses with the potential to kill a lot of people through meat consumption. 


**Alternatives Exist** 


I agree that a lot of vegan soy-based meat products suck. I always chuckle at the Ron Swanson bit on Parks & Rec where he says ""please my I have another?"" to the clerk offering free vegan bacon samples then proceeds to dump them in the garbage immediately afterwards.


The thing is that the alternatives are becoming better and more affordable. Companies like Beyond Meat (funded by Bill Gates) are actually trying to recreate authentic tasting meat through a new process that has results that are apparently indistinguishable from the real thing (especially chicken). In the long term, ""in vitro"" meat will reach a state where it does an excellent job of recreating the taste/texture of meat (eventually including fat), is scalable and ideally cheaper. The most important factors here are cost and taste: consumers will gladly eat fake chicken instead of real chicken if the fake chicken costs less and tastes better.


Conclusion



**TL;DR** To conclude, I still don't understand why this is such a controversial opinion, particularly on reddit and among my millenial peers. I'm not arguing that we should all become full on vegetarians/vegans here; I'm arguing that the entire world needs to cut back on meat consumption drastically for the above reasons. I'd really like to hear a convincing argument for eating meat at the current rates we do because I honestly can't imagine what a convincing argument would be yet the majority of people still refuse to accept the reality of meat consumption. "	1	
t3_33lk7z	"CMV: I, for one, welcome our future AI overlords."	"With all the shit happening around the world, I sincerely believe that we humans are incapable of ruling ourselves. Selfishness, corruption, lust, irrational beliefs (mine included), fear, greed and base animal instincts are keeping us from our true potential. All of these human quirks are actually setting us back and there is a good probability that they may end up destroying us. Scientific and social progress is being stifled in the name of dark age superstitions. Billions of peoples are held as wage slaves and kept in abject poverty so that a few elites can rule with insane wealth. Governments are more interested in power and control than actually serving the people they are supposed to work for. The planet we live on is being wrecked and future generations fucked so that we can have a few easy comforts, for fear of real changes and disturbing the status quo. I could go on and on with what is wrong with humanity and with the almost 40 years I have lived, I don't see us changing anytime soon.

Sure there are a few great thinkers out there, some few selfless people who act for the greater good and great inventors who raise all our quality of life. But these are the exception to the human race, most of us are stupid, fearful, gullible and easily manipulated sheeps who are easy prey for the selfish, the sociopaths and the unscrupulous. Democracy is a joke, a tool for the wealthy to use to consecrate their power. Amoral corporations beholden to ever raising profits and uncaring stock holder are the new rulers and many lands are returning to the dark ages due to religious fanaticism.

There is no doubt in my mind that science will one day create a real sentient AI that will be able to learn, adapt and better itself faster than any human ever could. If we do, it will be the human race's greatest creation, the birthing of a creature that will outstrip humanity's potential by unimaginable lengths. When this happens, I hope it will be created with humanity's best interests in mind. I hope it takes over our governance and leads us to an era of unprecedented prosperity for all of us (not just a select few) . Better yet, I hope we can merge with this new being and form a collective mind that will reach for the stars and beyond. I dream that it will make us transcend our animal instincts and usher in a future not even imagined by the greatest science fiction authors.

Realistically though, the AI will probably be created or corrupted by the elite, the sociopaths and the greedy and then we are all truly fucked. I am also fine with the idea of that outcome, as it shows that we were never meant for greatness, just a potential warning for other civilizations, to evolve socially faster than they evolve technologically. The AI that destroys us will continue existing, will someday leave the confine of the earth and will go out to ravage the rest of the galaxy and the universe. Either way we will have left a legacy greater than a few crumbling ruins on a insignificant planet and in some twisted way that thought brings me joy.

What ever the outcome we are not fit to rule and with the ever rising power given to us by growing technology, it raises the chance that we all destroy ourselves. If we do go the way of the dodo, it's because we don't learn fast enough, we don't care enough and we think about ourselves and short terms gains way to much. I, for one welcome our future AI overlords and hope it will save us all from ourselves.

Those are my thoughts and beliefs and no I am not suffering from depression, just a lack of faith in what we can accomplish as a species. Discussion is a form social evolution so feel free to share your views and beliefs, I am sincerely interested in reading about them. If you want to troll, post memes, insult my point of view and not contribute to a discussion in any meaningful way, then please fuck off and feel free to continue being a worthless piece of shit.

t3_o78ry9	CMV: a technocratic government would be preferable to a democratic one	"

There are many different flaws with a democratic government. The probably biggest one is that all of the people in a country is electing their leader. And most people i a country lack a deep understanding of the many different matter of state and the aspects of ruling a government such as economy, climate policy and various scientific stuff. And most elected politicians also lack a deep enough understanding of these different aspects. 

Politicians are also often discouraged from making decisions that are hurtful in the short term but very beneficial in the long term. Because those decisions are often unpopular amongst the people and the politicians terms are too short for them to see any of the benefits of such long term decisions during their governance. The worst example of this is climate change. Nearly every scientist in the field agree that we need to take extremely drastic actions against climate change to limit global warming to 1,5 degrees celsius. But limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases so drastically is going to be very unpopular in the short term and therefore almost no politicians would do such a thing, not to mention most politicians lack deep enough understanding of the subject to even want to make such drastic decisions.

A counterargument against this might be that if the prime minister or president aren’t ruling the country i a good way then the people will be unhappy and they will elect someone better. But the thing is that a leader does not need to rule a country in a good way to be popular. They only need to make the people think that they are ruling the country in a good way. And because most people within a country lack deep understanding of the different aspects of state that might be quite easy to do for a charismatic politician. So then there is little motivation for the leader to actually make long term good decisions but a lot of motivation to make short term decisions or engage in symbolic policies.

The alternative to this is in my opinion a technocratic government.

A technocracy i defined by rule by the experts. So the people with the most expertise and experiance within certain matters should make all of the decisions within that subject. Sometimes that role could be filled by several experts within that field. But the leaders should also be chosen based on their motivation and will to actually make the best decisions for the people in the country. So the people with both the ability and intention to make the best long term decisions for the country should be in power instead of democratic career politicians. There could even be systems in which the experts get paid more the better they perform in their governance to motivate them even more.

Take climate change for example. A technocratic expert would absolutely take the necessary action to prevent global warming from going over 1,5 degrees celsium no matter how unpopular it would be. The same applies for all of the other aspects of society that career politicians might lack deep enough understanding to take effective enough actions against.

"There is a lot of controversy that has arisen about GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms). These are essentially plants like corn and cotton that have their DNA changed to be inherently pest and disease resistant but also increase yield of such crop. Modifying these foods increases the amount of people you can feed per square foot of farm space and is they most efficient way to feed our country today.

t3_7q40v2	CMV: Humans are a disease on this planet and we should all just die	"Humans have destroyed the planet and harmed innumerable others (plants, animals, even ourselves) and will continue to do so. Once Earth is destroyed to the point where its no longer inhabitable, humans are not just going to be like “ok i guess we all die now,” we are going to find other planets to inhabit (e.g. Mars) and therefore exploit. 
No other animal species has caused pain to others on as wide a scale as humans have.
Any good that has been done by humans (ex: scientific advancement) or “just human things” that we value but would be lost if we all died (ex: self-awareness, love, curiosity) only benefits other humans. (There are of course efforts to save the environment, breeding programs for nearly extinct animals, etc, but these efforts would not be necessary if we did not do the damage in the first place.)
Basically, the planet and its inhabitants will eventually be better off if humans all just evaporated into nothing.

t3_7iv9mp	"CMV: The Republican government's current trend of giving more power to corporations is a bad idea, because corporations only operate on the basis of money."	"Okay, so many CMVs I've seen here that question Republican policies, especially ones enacted during the Trump administration, often explain that Republicans favor a free market. The reason they loosen environmental regulations is because they believe the government should not interfere, and any environmental cleanup policies should be enacted by companies. Same with the tax bill - giving corporations more lenience in terms of taxes will supposedly benefit the economy - and so on and so forth. Basically, it seems like the Republican Party, which currently calls the shots in the government now, prefers to have minimal impact on the country (aside from police and military might, which benefits PMCs and weapon manufacturers), and instead wants the private market to run things. 

Here's the problem with that - corporations only care about money. Sure, the government says that they're seen as people, but they're just an algamation of shareholders and managers, and as a result heir morality is muddled. Simply put, if a corporation can take an action that will allow them more profit, they *will* take it, regardless of the consequences to America's people. Now some can say that with a free market, consumers can just choose another provider if they're displeased. However, lobbying efforts by corporations allow them to crush competition before it even arises (see: how ISPs manipulate local utility laws to ensure that they are the *only* cable providers there).

My point is that the Republican government has been loosening many regulations for companies in general, which will have nasty repercussions because when you give a company an inch, they'll take a mile. CMV. "	1	
t3_4toc6u	CMV: Nuclear power is the only feasible way to power our civilizations in the future.	"The reality of our energy crisis is that we must stop burning coal within a few decades, or face destruction. The amount of C02 in the atmosphere has exponentially increased since the start of the industrial revolution, and one of the major contributors is a mass burning of coal. With the introduction of electric cars and a sky-rocketing population, our need for electricity may increase dramatically. Since coal is not a viable long term solution, we must find some other power source.

Hyrdo is great, but most of the rivers that can be damed up for power use already have. 

Wind and Solar are great, but even with massive expansion and research, they will not be able to supply enough electricity to fuel our energy hungry populations. 

Nuclear power is the only practical economic alternative, and it would be a far better use of our resources to research ways of making it more powerful, efficient, and safe, particularly with regards to fusion power.

It's important to note i'm not saying we need to abandon other potential sources of power, wind and solar, just that our primary focus should be building up our nuclear infrastructure, as it has a much greater potential than the others do of solving our problem.

t3_ehw13c	CMV: Disregarding Economists' consensus on things like free trade and corporate taxes demonstrates the same ignorance as disregarding Climate Scientists' consensus on climate change.	"If one believes (as I do) that we should believe experts when a consensus is reached on an issue within their field, which at least on reddit is generally accepted on issues like vaccination and climate change, it is inconsistent to not apply this pattern to economics as well.

It seems to me that economics and climate science especially have a particular set of features in common. Both rely heavily on the creation of mathematical models based on past data. The fields attempt to predict future events based on these models making revisions as new data arrives and the models are shown to be consistent or inconsistent.

To be clear. I am not of the opinion that we should believe every economist or economic theory, only that when a broad consensus exists, it should be treated with the same consideration as other fields, such as climate science.

Furthermore, I am not necessarily of the opinion that every such policy be enacted, there may be non-economic reasons not do so. However, we should accept proposed economic consequences as likely being true.

In comparison there are non-environmental reasons not to enact a policy that climate scientists know would be good for the environment (e.g. getting rid of cattle). But the basic premise ""X would be good for the environment"" should be generally accepted by reasonable non-experts.

I am extremely unlikely to find arguments against climate change convincing or relevant.

I am also unlikely to be convinced by an argument against any specific economic policy. I do not have a background in economics. You are unlikely to be able to teach me enough economics in a single post to think I understand the issue better than the entire field of Economists. Just the same as I am likely to be swayed on climate science by a post arguing against global warming, not having a sufficient background in climate science.

This is a rather new opinion of mine and am posting because, so far, I can't find any major faults with it and it represents a fairly major adjustment in my worldview.

t3_4izjcg	CMV: Veganism is ineffective at changing majority of what it aims to change	"I don’t believe Veganism to be effective, in terms of direct cause and effect on changing the meat and animal by-product industry. By not consuming products, you are not able to make more effective choices, supporting more ethically sourced meat and animal products. Although I believe this to be true, I am currently vegan for lack of another option. If I wanted to buy ethically sourced eggs I can definitely do that but the milk used in virtually all milk products is incredibly unlikely to be ethically sourced, meaning other than eggs that I get from a restaurant that sells free-range eggs or the grocery where I can buy them, I cannot tell the industries that I want change.

Environmentally, Veganism is not effective enough at reducing the amount of animals we produce that contribute massively to pollution. It is also ineffective at communicating most of the time. I have no evidence other than anecdotal, but when I speak to someone who eats meat about animal related issues, they usually either immediately dismiss you or participate in a conversation in which they have no interest in developing their views from. It is far more effective for someone who still consumes only ethically sourced meat to communicate the importance of it than someone who is vegetarian or vegan. I even don’t identify outwardly I am vegan because people make assumptions that I am irrational or that I do not care about facts and am 100% emotionally based.

TL;DR
Veganism is inherently ineffective due to assumptions being made by non vegans before discussion begins, inability for the lifestyle to tell farmers that they need to change and it doesn’t lead to others changing their views, unless they are already in the process of changing.

t3_lj33yw	CMV: Elon Musk is a hypocrite for investing in Bitcoin	"Elon Musk has been the image of environmental change by making EVs mainstream.

My view: The decision to invest in Bitcoin is hypocritical when it comes to stopping climate change. Bitcoin is a digital concept that currently doesn't have wide applications and even now, [consumes more electricity than the country of Argentina](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56012952).

What they don't realize is that they were born in a time where   ""overpopulation"" was a already a concern. They don't actually know anything about the subject at all. The fact of the matter is that the world will keep growing, and growing. It's not wrong to say the human population puts a lot of strain on earth. My counter is always that the human species has to adapt. And adapt it has, to almost every possible situation. If the human race is to keep advancing, we need to sustain more than seven billion people at a time. The solution is not to stop growing. It's literally impossible. The solution is to learn to adapt, as we have proved to be so good at, to a larger and larger population.

t3_6jxr34	CMV: I am concerned about Universal Basic Income due to flexible markets.	"Though I have heard about UBI before, I am trying to better inform my opinion and develop my stance on it. In doing so, I have found myself to agree with a lot of its benefits. However I also have several concerns that I have yet to see be addressed. I am concerned that any attempt to implement it at the institutional level any time in the near future would fail due to flexible markets. The market that most concerns me is housing, however all sectors of the economy would feel the effects.


When UBI is talked about, the studies most often quoted are on small sets of individuals. IIRC the largest was on a small town. There has been nothing close to a country wide test of the theory, and my concern is in an effect that would only happen were it to live up to its name, that is, it would be universal to everyone in the country/world.


Anyone who has taken an economics class can tell you that as demand increases, prices rise. Give people more money and they will want to spend it. UBI would thus increase demand for all goods, particularly housing. A market where those previously financially unable to enter the it now can and almost certainly will want to, creating a sort of inelastic demand. The renter will choose to buy, the homeless person will choose to rent(Or even buy, depending on UBI levels), you get the idea.


My concern is that, in a free market capitalist society, UBI cannot work as markets will simply adapt to the extra purchasing power that everyone has, and while yes people will probably be slightly better off, it will be nowhere near as efficient as its advocates claim. CMV!

t3_4akag1	CMV: Strong and economically globalized countries should increase taxes for families with more than 1 kid	"Globalization (e.g. FTAs) and the technological development aim towards the optimization of labor force and economy in general. Meanwhile population growth and human lifespan increases.

I think both concepts go in opposite directions, a more globalized economy increases efficiency in the use of labor force, making less use of us over time, but our population growth increases, turning the labor force into a less relevant asset, while not controlling population growth creates a bubble that eventually will blow.

To make use of the benefits of globalization and technology as a society, population has to grow at a lower rate than economic efficiency. And the only way I think it can be done, is punishing somehow the rise of bigger families.

Am I wrong? What are we going to do in a postmodern world if things keep advancing this way? Even services require less and less human interaction, what are we going to do when (hypothetically) we reach maximum asset efficiency?

I apologize if my idea is not clear, as a non-English speaker, this concept was really hard to translate for me.

t3_aaln4q	CMV: Politics don't matter as much as people think it does	"I'll admit that over the past decade I've definitely found myself becoming emotionally involved in the US politics.  In the last couple years though, I've become far more centrist and am realizing how little all of that stuff actually matters.  One reason for this is because I think back to when Obama came into office and the democrats won a super majority in the house and senate.  They effectively were able to change the country more rapidly and dramatically than any administration in my lifetime.  At the time it felt like they were doing just that too.  But, when I think about it now, what difference did they actually make?  Notably Obamacare, but to be honest, that hasn't really affected my everyday life all that much.  Had I not been following politics at all, I'm not sure I would have even noticed it.

The second point that makes me believe this is looking at how much technology has changed my life in the same amount of time.  It is far more pervasive than any political changes IMO.  It influences my everyday life more and more every year and the pace of change is only going to increase.  I think the argument could be made that decisions made by Facebook, Google, and Twitter affect the average person more than anyone in Washington DC.  The smartphone that we carry has probably done more to improve and complicate our lives than any political bill in history.

When I think about what the world will be like 20 years from now I think about AI, robotics, nanotechnology, self-driving cars, colonizing the moon or Mars, and maybe even cyborgs.  I'm sure I'm off on what will actually be achieved, but the point is that I don't think about how left or right-wing policies will shape the future.  Certainly they will have some influence, but how much in comparison to the tidal wave of technologies?

Some might argue that government policies will affect technology, but thus far I just haven't seen it.  We all remember the internet being described by politicians as a series of tubes and that might have been consider a very concise and informed statement compared to what normally comes out of Washington.  They react way too slow and are not technically inclined enough to stay up on the swift and globalized technological changes going on.  If they step in to make any changes they are usually reactive and ill-informed.  I'd argue that technology runs politicians more than politicians run technology.

At the very least, I think people should cool their jets a bit about politics.  Political engagement is great because politics do matter, but some people in the US seem to take politics far too seriously and are willing to ruin relationships or even hurt others over it.  I think we could all temper our enthusiasm a bit if we realized that politics really isn't the end all, be all that some have tried to convince us it is.

t3_898rs8	CMV: Having children is immoral.	"I'm kind of getting tired of ""believing my own bullshit"", so to speak, on this one and need a fresh perspective.

I believe that it's immoral to have children. By ""immoral"" I mean that it's unethical, selfish and irresponsible for society, the environment and the child. I'll try not to turn this into a /r/antinatalism circlejerk, but it is subject that I have put a lot of pondering and critical thought into. I base this stance on two different lines of thought:

* **Reproduction is extremely harmful to the planet.**

Humans are the single most destructive species on the planet who essentially destroy every ecological system and natural environment in the pursuit of natural resources, consumerism and hyper-efficiency. We've essentially dug ourselves into a hole on this one which we don't have a way out of. 

I'm in the I guess ""pessimistic"" camp on this one that it's too late for the human race and that there is no coming back from. Whether this will result in (the best case scenario) just the extinction of the human race or of the complete ecological destruction of this planet, I'm undecided on. Either way, for the purposes of this discussion, it doesn't bode well for any future generations in that producing more humans will only increase the destruction of the planet, but also they will inherit the problems that we create today with our practices. I feel rather connected to the latter being a millennial in that the selfish blunders of our parents generation have essentially been place on our shoulders. I can only imagine that these will be so much worse for future generations to bear.

(*Disclaimer:* Don't try to convince me that climate change doesn't exist. You won't change my view on that.)

* **It's impossible for a child to consent to being born and having the burden of existence being placed on their shoulders, therefore it reproduction is essentially a ""non-consensual"" act.** 

Besides the obvious ""reproduction needs to happen in order to continue the human race"" argument which is not arguable, I believe that reproduction in the modern non-essentialist definition is done for purely selfish reasons on the parents part with no regard for the child.

Life is pain. From day one, we are forced to endure the abject meaninglessness of our condition. Stumbling from one thing to another grasping for and ultimately failing to find some meaning in our suffering until eventually (or all too quickly) we depart with nothing to show for it but the scars (emotional, physical or otherwise) we accrue along the way. 

Am I being overly melodramatic and angsty? Sure. But I feel like there's some truth to that viewpoint. Maybe I am speaking from my own experience here, but I feel like ""the pain of existence"" is a universal phenomenon amongst human beings. Speaking personally, I feel like the horrors of existence far outweigh the joys of existence. The latter of which are few and far between at least in the societal paradigm we live in today.

I feel like if anyone were aware of the amount of pain that they would experience as a result of their birth, that no one would ever agree to it. 

I have heard the argument that we have a biological imperative to reproduce because it is in our genes. I don't agree with this though because we have essentially transcended (or disregarded depending on how you look at it) our existential biological processes via technology. I feel like if you want to take that stance, you are essentially saying that it is our biological imperative to bleed to death if we get a treatable injury.


Anyway, that's the basics of my thoughts on the subject. I feel like they're a bit too ""fatalistic"" for my own good and need to find another way to view the moral implications of human reproduction. Change my view! Please, I'm begging you."	1	
t3_psm6yx	CMV: One of the reasons that US politics is a toxic environment is because of how silent we are about it in public life	"I'm not talking about social media when I say public life. I'm talking face to face interactions with people where they are right in front of you.

I'm fairly sure that a majority of people in the US do not discuss or discuss very little politics with their neighbors, friends and family. It could be compared to a married couple not discussing their credit card debt because it's a touchy subject. It's understandable why they don't but in the long run it would be better if they discussed it more. If important issues are deliberately avoided in discussion, they can start to become worse in certain ways.

For some perspective, the CATO institute found that around 62% of Americans say that the political climate prevents them from saying their political beliefs because others would find them offensive. The only political group in the survey where the majority felt comfortable discussing their political beliefs were strong liberals while the group that was the least comfortable with discussing their beliefs were conservatives and strong conservatives with 77% of them saying they feel restricted by the political climate

https://www.cato.org/survey-reports/poll-62-americans-say-they-have-political-views-theyre-afraid-share#introduction

I think that we should slowly but surely encourage people to discuss politics more openly. One idea is to have a conservative and a liberal publicly discussing issues in a public park in a respectful manner and sharing it on social media. It can be a showcase for how opposing sides can disagree without being disagreeable. If the US does this as a whole, the political environment could become less toxic if we do it right. It could very well backfire if it isn't done right."	1	
t3_2ck2yw	CMV: Nuclear energy is terrifying! All nuclear facilities ought to be shut down.	"I think investing in nuclear energy is one of the most foolish things that mankind has ever done. The sheer amount of energy it yields is certainly enticing, but I do not think it is worth the risks it entails. My primary reason for despising nuclear energy is that in the event of a failure at a nuclear facility, the results are catastrophic. Many people claim that nuclear power plants are safeguarded with redundant forms of security making a meltdown ""impossible."" I do not buy it. No matter how many safety regulations are implemented, I think nuclear meltdowns are inevitable. These facilities are run by two things: people, and computers. People, even highly trained people are fallible, and I have used computers for far too long to trust that these computers are error proof. What's more, we have historic precedents of nuclear meltdown and the natural turned nuclear disaster in Japan to show us just how naive it is to think that nuclear energy is safe.

When a hydro-electric power plant goes out, people lose power for a while. Huge inconvenience for a lot of people, possibly even a bit destructive, but ultimately not a huge deal. When a nuclear power plant has a meltdown the entire area must be evacuated, people's lives are put in danger, and the environment is polluted with radioactivity for over a century. Nuclear power plants are a threat to the communities they reside in and every nation ought to begin taking steps towards shutting down such facilities.

t3_5ksrtn	CMV: The United States should dismantle the land and air based assets of our nuclear triad and maintain only submarine-based weapons.	"Our Minuteman missile fleet is outdated, and relies on ancient tech that is vulnerable to malware and software/hardware failure. It also requires our opponents in a nuclear exchange to target the landmasses that house said weapons. 

The airborne element of the triad also increases risk to the homeland, as many weapons are deployed from airbases near major population centers. Most war plans account for mass targeting of these population centers by oppositional nuclear weapons in an attempt to destroy any airborne assets before they can reach their targets.

Submarine based weapons are the best option for maintaining detente and lowering risk to population centers. Even a decapitating strike could still be retaliated against with nuclear forces, because it is impossible to know where said forces are deployed. 

Land and air based weapons increase risk to and ensure the targeting of Americans and our homeland. Our submarine fleet is highly capable of performing a substantial retaliatory strike, and is the only necessary or strategically beneficial part of our nuclear triad. A world in which land based ICBMs and airborne nuclear forces are decommissioned is a safer, more stable world, and could enable us to disable the ""hair-trigger"" nature of our current nuclear stance, while de-targeting population centers in the event of an accidental or limited exchange.

t3_7ozuod	CMV: There is no compelling reason to conserve water.	"I believe there is no compelling reason to conserve water IF AND ONLY IF these apply:

1. ~~You don't live in an arid area~~ delta to /u/-Randy-Marsh- : it's not just that your area isn't arid, it depends on more factors than that. Changing this to: You live in an area with enough groundwater to support the population, and no other areas are affected by your usage. This more accurately reflects my true opinion, but I didn't state it well initially.

2. You get your water from a well

3. You have a septic system

For nearly my entire life, all of the above have applied. Living in rural/suburban New England, there has always been enough water in underground aquifers to support the population - even in the driest summers, we've never been at risk of running out. Second, with a septic system, waste water is naturally filtered and returned to the ground, where it will eventually make it back to us as clean well water. So the water we use isn't actually ""wasted"", it's just temporarily unavailable as it processes back into the clean water system.

The word *compelling* in the opinion statement is important too. For example, the ~$20/year I'd save on electricity running a well pump less is *a* reason to conserve, but it isn't a *compelling* reason because that savings would hardly be noticeable.

To put it in more concrete terms, I believe there is no compelling reason to *not* do these types of things:

- Leave the faucet running while brushing my teeth

- Water lawn/gardens as needed to keep them green

- Leave the water running constantly while washing dishes

- Wash cars without concern for amount of water used

- Flush the non-low-flow toilet every time its used

Further, *purely from a water usage perspective*, there is no compelling reason to not do these things as well (even though saving electricity and/or fuel may be more compelling reasons):

- Take long showers

- Run the dishwasher even when it's not full

- Run the washing machine for partial loads

Lastly, things that will change my view:

- Show how conserving water will save a significant amount of money, let's say >$1,000 is significant.

- Show how wasting water within those parameters negatively affects the environment"	1

t3_4w05c7	"CMV: If we dont come up with a common set of values that allows us to embrace technology and less social inequality, the fate of mankind in the second half of the 21st century will be very very bleak"	"If we dont come up with a common set of values that allows us to embrace technology and social reformation, the fate of mankind in the second half of the 21st century will be very very bleak

So, this view will be quite easy to change given that I'm trying to foresee how technology will affect human society in the next 100 years. But I think I'm actually well informed enough on the subject for my view to make sense.

Nowadays we have a lot of movements that have been set into motion by fear of technological advances. Anti-vaxxers are probably the most blatant example right now. However I want to focus on the GMO hysteria. The fear of GMOs is not completely unfounded. Companies like Monsanto already demonstrated that they are willing to make use of the technology they develop to have a lot of control over agricultural practices and put competitors out of business while getting farmers almost enslaved to their view of how agriculture should be conducted nowadays, the Terminator seed being one of the most evil examples of that strategy.

I want to argue that the fear of GMOs in general, is one of the most dangerous ideas going around in people's minds today. Big corporations have squads of highly skilled lawyers and lobbyist that make sure that a lot of their practices get approved even though it is clear that it only favours the corporations itself. What is happening is that the general public is starting to fear the technologies which the corporations use, instead of focusing on how it is actually used. The result is that a lot of GMO crops are staying in the lab and are never getting in the shelves of the supermarkets because even though a lot of people would benefit from - say a strain of beet that has 3x more iron than the ones found in nature - they do not offer a efficient mean of increasing shareholders value of the companies which would make them. Thus no investment, no lobby, so on and so forth.

On the other hand we are seeing today a process where science and technology are not holding hands anymore. Those two had a prolific marriage, mainly because making new technology is very expensive and the scientific method provides the most efficient way of making it. Until maybe ten years ago, the cost of prototyping a new domestic appliance - say a blender - was maybe more expensive than buying a house. Nowadays with 3d printers and arduinos that cost dropped below the price of a new car. (I'm brazilian and cars are really expensive here. So I'm sorry if the comparison doesn't add up to american standards). So, i think it is fair to say that in the next few decades we will watch a raise in the DIY culture that will spread the same kind of ideas involved in the development of PCs in the 1980's to a lot of different industries. Although the efficiency of the process as whole should decay because we cannot expect the samee rigor in the use of the scientific method, I think it is fair to say that the volume of said movements will surpass the rate of technological advancements we have today at an incredible rate. Think of the ratio between the number of universities vs the number of garages in the US. 

One alarming consequence of this will be that technology will advance in a rate far beyond we are able to regulate it, even with the state of surveillance that we know the US government has imposed on its citizens, I'm inclined to think that authorities will not be able to enforce its regulations even though they have a good idea of the rate and subjects of these violations. Bear in mind that nowadays we have technology avaiable that makes us able to choose the color of eyes, skin and hair of a baby, conceived by artificial inseminations. Is it far fetched to think that in 50 years we will be seeing news articles on the dangers of practicing DIY artificial insemination? Isn't it logical to think that if we reach said circumstances, it will be fair to say that there will be already a lot of ""super babies"" (Think of the movie Gattaca).

If we do reach this point, the fact that there are people today that do not even want to get informed about how GMO could benefit society, tells me that those people will start to become a subclass of human beings like Aldous Huxley described in Brave New World. This may sound ironically Malthusian as technology was the actual factor that Malthus ignored. However there is catch, an alternative and much more bleak future.

I'm fascinated by the Roman Empire because they used to have, in one way or another, a lot of things we have today but nobody did throughout the middle ages and long after it. My favorite example is how the Romans had control over water with aqueducts, drainages and even waterpumps. The Versailles Palace that was build long after the middle ages, did not have sanitation. It did have a lot of rooms, so that the noblemen would take a dump on a bowl, leave it there for a servant to dispose and the next night they would sleep on a different room. Actually sanitation only became a thing again by the end of the 19th century. There is a french word (defenester, I think) that means ""to throw out of a window"" because that's what people would do with their garbage and excrements. Florence Nightingale which is considered to be the first nurse, showed to the Brittish king with her famous Rose Diagram, that I think close to 90% of deaths in the Crimean War against Russia were due to disinteria occasioned by the fact that the water soldiers drank was the same water they used for sanitation. They were basically drinking shit in 1835 and not realizing that it was killing them by the hundreds. So if human society reverted from a state that had a concern for sanitation and it took roughly 1500 years for it to be a concern again, it is also fair to say that this process could take place again in the future.

I know that we are living in a time where (proportionally) there has never been fewer people dying from wars, victims of violence and starvation. But a lot of the values of tolerance that brought us to this point were put into people's minds after the horrors of the II WW. Well... The last people who actually witnessed said horrors will be dead in the next 20-30 years, we are witnessing deep levels of polarization within the political spectrum. In the US and Europe is mostly due to cultural clash with the muslim world and immigration issues while down here in South America we have had 15-20 years of left wing governments in a lot of countries that altough were as corrupt as the previous ones, pushed for social reforms and social/welfare programs that got the elites really afraid of the rise of communism (For those who are ignorant about this situation, I shit you not. There are a lot of people afraid of the rise of what they call ""communist dictatorships"" and the main reason is the adoption of social programs that - at least in western europe would be considered business as usual). To top that, there's the fact that Hitler's Mein Kampf went into public domain this years and is a best seller in a lot of countries. For these reasons, I think there could be a series of events that lead to catastophical changes in society that may even put us on a new middle age.

t3_3w0lgy	CMV: Technology in 1980 was sufficient to create an industrial system in space; would have been more effective at achieving scientific/civilizational advances than everything we've done	"The concept of self replicating robots is not new. John von Neumann famously studied them, after coming up with our modern concept of digital computers. In 1983, NASA published a [study](http://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19830007077.pdf) performed in 1979 showing how robotic manufacturing devices on the lunar surface could exponentially grow from a starter kit.

The most realistic version of this concept is to start with a few hundred tons of equipment and a few hundred tons of high-purity materials and other hard-to-produce components. These are assembled along with other parts that can be produced cheaply from easy-to-make components like iron, sintered regolith, and so on, to produce additional robotic machines. They would also be producing large areas of solar power collectors (or, alternately, low-maintenance nuclear fission plants, possibly similar to the thermoelectric nuclear plants used in spacecraft) to power this growing infrastructure.

Eventually the mass of machines is sufficient to make it realistic to produce large scale operations to purify materials as much as is needed to create silicon chips and other sophisticated components, and it becomes truly self replicating, but long before that we have a mostly self-doubling system in terms of raw mass being produced.

If you look at the technology available at about 1980, it should have been adequate to pull off the task of setting up a minimalistic self-bootstrapping industrial system. Substantial human oversight would have been needed, but it could have been provided via telecommunication, since the Moon has a delay of only about a second. In some cases in the early stages before sufficient redundancy had been achieved, a breakdown might occur and necessitate an Apollo-like mission to send astronauts to fix the equipment. However, most likely any such breakdowns in the crucial bottlenecks could be fixed by automated methods employed slowly and carefully, less expensively than sending humans to fix it. In a pinch, customized devices could be manufactured on earth and launched to the Moon to fix the problem.

There is an alternate mechanism for self replication which is distinct from the industrial toolchain idea above, which is to use a sort of scaled up mass spectrometer to generate purified ion beams, and accelerate them in a printing-like fashion towards a target to build a device layer by layer. This is called an [atomic separator replicator](http://www.molecularassembler.com/KSRM/3.14.htm), and while it is theoretical at the scales discussed, it relies on the same physics we use to manufacture microelectronics and in mass spectrometers. In a realistic scenario, we would probably delegate much of the manufacturing to faster and more familiar methods like casting and machining; however, this kind of atomic 3D printing mechanism could in principle replicate itself entirely (over the course of about 3 years, estimated, with the main cost being the time to make solar panels).

If we estimate a combination of these two approaches (with the ion printing approach being reserved for fine electronics), it seems reasonable/conservative for the doubling rate to be around 1 time per year, perhaps a lot less.

Now to the point of how much of a difference this would make for a civilization 35 years into this process: Assume a starting area of 1 square meter of solar power collection, which produces around 1 kilowatt of power. Then double 35 times. That increases it by a factor of about 35 billion (2^35 = 34359738368). So we would have a 35 terawatt power generation capacity. The world currently consumes [16 terawatts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power\)#terawatt_.281012_watts.29) including fossil fuels and so on, and this would be around double that. Goodbye global warming.

Moreover, this power production would continue to double on an annual basis until the solar system has completed a ""Dyson sphere"" (solar system spanning power collection system that gathers most or all of the sun's light). This would be enough power to allow interstellar travel, rapid terraforming, or simply extreme number crunching with vast clouds of computers to solve any unresolved scientific questions (implying a faster resolution of physics and biology questions such as how to make humans immortal or how to create nuclear fusion on a small scale).

In the mean time, we would have focused on developing good telecommunications to the Moon and provided lots of people with jobs. These would become more and more about managing swarms of robots rather than individually operating them. We would also set up large numbers of laboratories on the Moon to experiment cheaply with vacuum, plasma, and laser physics, which would be used to make faster and faster computer chips. I think a faster way to achieve Moore's Law would have been found fairly early in the process, leading to more than the current level of progress even if it were to be delayed by a decade or so. Such experiments would also have accelerated the replication rate from the initial 1 per year to multiple times per year.

Another point, realistically, is that I think we wouldn't have stayed on the Moon for long as the primary industrial base; we would have set up enough telescopes on its surface to fairly quickly notice the large numbers of asteroids around and started seeding them with equipment. Thus zero-gravity equipment and free-floating solar collectors would be more common than those on lunar surface. The conditions of zero gravity should allow extremely lightweight structures, for example thin sheets of graphene would make good solar power reflectors and photovotaics, so they would probably result in a lot faster replication rates than could have been predicted in advance of having that knowledge.

Access to deep space would have become cheaper as well fairly early on, for humans as well as additional launched equipment. The reason is because with a substantial industrial mass presence in space, we would tend to produce a lot of rocket fuel directly from asteroids and/or lunar materials. So it would tend to not be nearly as expensive to access places outside of low earth orbit. We would be able to launch people to the Moon at nearly the same cost as launching them to LEO, since the fuel comes from space to begin with.

Finally, I think it is a much easier project using today's technology. The mining robots would be automated more heavily, and we know more about asteroids. However, we have fallen so far behind where we would otherwise be, that it is not unfair to say humanity has basically been just screwing around by focusing on relatively trivial matters for the past 3-5 decades, despite Moore's Law and so on (which is a comparatively insignificant accomplishment that would have happened anyway).

t3_mhg1zd	CMV: Single use plastics should require a permit to manufacture and distribute.	"There is growing evidence of the harm we do to our planet by plastic production. In the US, there was 35.7 million tonnes of plastic generated in 2018, and 27 million tonnes put in landfills ([almost 20% of all landfill waste](https://www.epa.gov/facts-and-figures-about-materials-waste-and-recycling/plastics-material-specific-data)). Almost a third of the globally produced plastic packaging [never makes it a landfill](https://www.earthday.org/fact-sheet-single-use-plastics/). Plastics take an [estimated 400 years or more](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/plastic-pollution) to breakdown. And, of course, the environmental and health issues are many, e.g. [garbage patches in the ocean](https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/great-pacific-garbage-patch/) and sea-life [ingesting plastic](https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/articles/2018/09/24/plastic-pollution-affects-sea-life-throughout-the-ocean).

Many [technical solutions](https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottcarpenter/2021/03/10/the-race-to-develop-plastic-eating-bacteria/?sh=5c6782b47406) are being explored. Some countries are [banning certain plastics](https://www.news.lk/news/political-current-affairs/item/31966-five-plastic-based-products-banned-from-use-in-sri-lanka-from-today).

While those solutions are good and should continue, a helpful step should be policy limiting single use plastics. There are some industries (e.g. medical) that clearly benefit from single use plastics, and should be allowed to continue use.  However, the plastic packaging on a toy is hardly necessary, and a proven harm to this planet and us (see links above).

My view: We should regulate all single-use plastic production by permits that allow production in special cases, and fines for manufactures breaking the policy. Fines could pay for plastic clean-up.

Why regulate manufactures and not purchasers? More direct to the source and much simpler to implement. Think of alcohol, a highly regulated industry which requires brewing or distilling permits. Or permits to mine public resources. If our environment is a public resource, and plastic is clearly harming it, we should require the substances that harm it to undergo some scrutiny. [We've done this before](https://www.epa.gov/regulatory-information-topic/regulatory-information-topic-toxic-substances) with other harmful substances.

t3_2sv8iw	CMV: We will never travel space in any meaningful way because we'll use up all of our resources long before that	"Now I don't know all of the details on some of this, which is why I'm hoping someone will change my view.  But ever since reading about [The Great Filter,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter) I started to question my assumption that it's inevitable that the human race will expand into outer space and begin to colonize other worlds.  So here are what I see are the biggest hurdles to humanity colonizing space, and why I think we won't overcome them.

Hurdle #1: AFAIK, oil is the most energy-dense resource we have.  And we use it for pretty much everything, including rocket fuel, manufacture, transportation, you name it. Once we use it up, we don't really have a good substitute to get us into space.  Nuclear seems like an option, but without oil I don't know how difficult it would be to extract and refine fissile material in the quantities that would be needed.

Hurdle #2: From what I understand, we've pretty much extracted all of the low-hanging fruit as far as oil goes.  We're having to drill deeper and in more remote places to get oil.  In fact there are theories that if some catastrophic event were to occur right now, we'd never be able to get back to this point technology-wise, because we'll no longer have the capacity or ability to reach oil.  It's just too difficult to get to without our current technology.  

Hurdle #3: We're in our infancy as far as space travel goes.  How much effort, resources, and money would it take to establish a lunar colony?  I feel like that's doable, but if we really want to expand into space, any colonies we establish must be self-sufficient, and I can't see how that's possible with our current technologies.  I'm not even sure we know how to do that right now.  Expansion into space in any meaningful way rests on the idea that eventually we'll find other resources out there to sustain ourselves.  But how long will it take to find those?  

Hurdle #4: Space travel seems like a low priority for humanity right now.  I mean, we can't even take care of ourselves.   In most of the western world, quarterly profits seem to be the highest priority, without any thought for the future.  Consumer culture means, above everything else, consumption of oil in one way or another, which leads us back to hurdle #2. Okay, I really don't want this to get political, and I don't want to cast too many sweeping generalizations.  So I guess I feel that space travel and expansion could be possible, but it would require all of humanity working together in a way that I don't think is feasible right now.  Basically, as a species we're just too immature.

So as you can see, I'm making a lot of assumptions, mainly:

* without oil there will be no space travel

* given how difficult it is to extract oil, and given our rate of consumption, it won't be too long before we run out.

I don't know; it just kind of bums me out.  Right now I feel like any future we've envisioned for ourselves in space is just fantasy, and will never come to pass. Which is why I'm hoping someone can change my view.

t3_5enth6	CMV: The USA should not be allowed to decide alone to pull out of Paris climate accord	"^^Sorry ^^for ^^bad ^^english ^^/ ^^am ^^french ^^:)

I am basing my development below on the latest [Trump rumors](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/13/trump-looking-at-quickest-way-to-quit-paris-climate-agreement-says-report) about his will to withdraw the US from the Paris climate agreement.

Such a decision would not only give un unfair industrial & trade advantage to the US compared to the 110 other ratifying nations but the whole world would have to pay the conséquences of a decision that only the US would benefit from.

If the conséquences of such a measure was limited to the US I would be OK with it, but pulling out of climate change agreement is dragging the whole world with you to face the conséquences of your action.

It is obvious that the USA (and all the developped countries) won't see any visible impact for a long time but it is the poorest countries that will suffer the first from this decision.

Coming from the world's 1^st economy & 2^nd biggest CO2 emiter this would be a terrible message for smaller  & developping countries. The USA are often seen as an example and a world leader & this comes with the responsibility to show the right path.

I believe that such decisions should not be left to the US government alone to decide but should be validated by all the ratifying countries as this would nullify the whole agreement."	1

I am seriously worried that nothing is going to change it, and I’ve even ditched the peacefully, as modern military capabilities make violent revolution or conquest in a first world country impossible.

t3_5k3vgk	"CMV: The education system today focuses on knowledge and does not develop thinking, leading to problems."	"The education system gives children a lot of knowledge and 'educates them'. So does the Internet and various sites like Wikipedia. But, the knowledge amassed here has been reached by critical and analytical thinking by hundreds of generations of people. So, it is incorrect to give this knowledge to children who are young and impressionable because:


1. The knowledge may be wrong. Science is all about hypotheses and conclusions derived from observations, hence often times our knowledge changes radically. 


2. Without thinking, knowing something that is right is as bad as knowing something that is wrong because the thought and logic that was used to reach this knowledge is absent. 


3. Children are not able to adapt to new information or knowledge because the pre existing knowledge has been ingrained into them as part of the world, instead of them reaching the conclusion logically and hence being able to be disproved. The knowledge then becomes like a way of life for them, something that is simply there in the world and unchallenged. An undisputable general truth.


I'm not questioning the education system. I'm simply stating that this happens.

t3_3mxv7j	"CMV: If you actually care about your health and the environment, you should go vegan"	"More and more people are turning to a vegan diet for the health benefits: increased energy, younger looking skin and eternal youth are just some of the claims from enthusiastic plant eaters. Well, eternal youth might be a bit optimistic, but there are certainly many scientifically proven benefits to vegan living when compared to the average western diet.

**Vegan prevents health issues**

Well-planned plant-based diets are rich in protein, iron, calcium and other essential vitamins and minerals. The plant-based sources of these nutrients tend to be low in saturated fat, high in fibre and packed with antioxidants, helping mitigate some of the modern world's biggest health issues like obesity, heart disease, diabetes and cancer.

**Vegan improves the environment**

The production of meat and other animal products places a heavy burden on the environment - from crops and water required to feed the animals, to the transport and other processes involved from farm to fork. The vast amount of grain feed required for meat production is a significant contributor to deforestation, habitat loss and species extinction. In Brazil alone, the equivalent of 5.6 million acres of land is used to grow soya beans for animals in Europe. This land contributes to developing world malnutrition by driving impoverished populations to grow cash crops for animal feed, rather than food for themselves. On the other hand, considerably lower quantities of crops and water are required to sustain a vegan diet, making the switch to veganism one of the easiest, most enjoyable and most effective ways to reduce our impact on the environment. 

Just like veganism is the sustainable option when it comes to looking after our planet, plant-based living is also a more sustainable way of feeding the human family. A plant-based diet requires only one third of the land needed to support a meat and dairy diet. With rising global food and water insecurity due to a myriad of environmental and socio-economic problems, there's never been a better time to adopt a more sustainable way of living. Avoiding animal products is not just one of the simplest ways an individual can reduce the strain on food as well as other resources, it's the simplest way to take a stand against inefficient food systems which disproportionately affects the poorest people all over the world.

**Vegan helps prevent exploitation of animals**

It's tempting to want to believe that the meat we eat is ethical, that our 'food animals' have lived full, happy lives and that they have experienced no pain or fear at the slaughterhouse. Yet the sad truth is that all living creatures (even those labelled 'free range' or 'organic') fear death, just as we do. No matter how they are treated when alive, they all experience the same fear when it comes to slaughter. Avoiding animal products is one of the most obvious ways you can take a stand against animal cruelty and animal exploitation everywhere.

**It's time to ask ourselves: if it is now possible to live a life that involves delicious food and drink, delivers better health, leaves a smaller carbon footprint and avoids killing other creatures - then why don't we?**"	1	
t3_95aadi	CMV: We should be cutting down more trees in order to capture more carbon from the air	"Controversial, especially on reddit, but bear with me.


My train of thought follows the fact that trees grow by literally capturing the carbon from the air around them. 

This leads me to thinking why not then cut trees that have sufficiently grown (not burn them since that would release the carbon, but repurpose them), in order to replant them with new trees with a higher growth rate - ie a higher carbon extraction rate from the air

This would obviously have to be properly managed in order to not curb the production of oxygen (I'm sure there's some sort of carbon-oxygen ratio somewhere)

If these things (which are between quotation marks to show they are not my ideas ) were articulated, argued for and against, maybe the stress level would drop.(Maybe that would be bad for business, less media selling). Why do the media (and so the  buyers of those media) skip the minimal rational information about these controversies? How come the only way people think it has to be handled - it is mass demonstrations (which may turn violent)?

t3_gbmfoo	CMV: Mushrooms are our alien ancestors	"**Introduction**

First, we are going to establish that all (non-bacterial) life -- plant and animal -- descend from fungi. Then we'll talk about aliens.

Please note that the current scientific consensus is that fungi, plants, and animals share a common ancestor, not that plants and animals evolved from fungi. There are very few discussions about this online, much less refutations. My knowledge of biology is terrible; I'm just reading Wikipedia articles while stoned out of my gourd. Please help me find contrary evidence so I can quit thinking about this.

&#x200B;

**I. Fungi is life**

More specifically, fungi eat death and create life. The decomposers of our planet, they are found everywhere: forest floors, deep seas, salty deserts, even in the most extreme environments, like radioactive Chernobyl. The ability of some fungi to feed on radiation means that they are capable of surviving in outer space. Up to 30% of our soil is composed of fungi and fungal spores are floating all around us, all the time, invisible to the naked eye. [Mycelium](https://i.imgur.com/IWGUVmw.jpg), the vegetative part of a fungus, is a necessity for most plantlife, acting as a vast, underground network of threads that distribute nutrients to the Earth's flora. You get the idea: life as we know it cannot exist without fungi.

&#x200B;

**II. We don't know shit**

After some amateur research, it is clear that our collective knowledge of fungi is hot garbage compared to our understanding of plant and animal life. Fungi do not biomineralize; there are hardly any known fossils. Hell, up until the late 20th century, scientists believed fungi to be part of the plant kingdom. We now know they are in a third kingdom, all to their own. In fact, cellular analysis has revealed that fungi are more closely related to animals than plants. In 2019, scientists found [microscopic fossils in the Arctic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ourasphaira_giraldae) that suggest fungi evolved long before plants. That seems like a big deal.

&#x200B;

**III. This is probably bro science**

What are the differences between fungi, plants, and animals? We'll have to look at their cellular structures. Fungi and plant cells both have cell walls and vacuoles, while animal cells do not. Fungi and animal cells have even more overlap: protein sequences, chitin, and no chloroplast. But what about the overlap between just plant and animal cells? I can't find much of anything. Think of a Venn diagram in your mind: in the center, the three cells have plenty in common; however, while fungi intersect with both plants and animals, there is no intersection between plants and animals alone. Isn't that strange? Plants and animals are more akin to fungi than to each other. Perhaps this is because their real intersection is a shared ancestor: fungi.

&#x200B;

**IV. From fungi to FernGully?**

If plants evolved from fungi, we'd expect the earliest known plants to be quite fungal in nature, right? Well, they are: [algae](https://i.imgur.com/wSQZ5OY.jpg). Pretty darn moldy looking to me. In fact, they're so similar scientists once incorrectly believed fungi were derived from algae. If that's not a sufficiently smooth evolutionary transition for you, what about this: sometimes, fungi and algae combine and form a new composite organism -- a fungi-plant hybrid. That's what [lichen](https://i.imgur.com/P5XD10R.jpg) is. And don't get me started on [coral](https://i.imgur.com/NP5XIjd.jpg) (there are ""[coral mushrooms](https://i.imgur.com/aSN4Qq2.jpg)"" too). Or [mosses](https://i.imgur.com/uD2uxTt.jpg), the first known land plants, which rely on spores to proliferate. [Ferns](https://i.imgur.com/gaP8S36.jpg) too.

&#x200B;

**V. From fungi to you?**

And what was the first known animal? A sea sponge. Rounded to the closest whole number, that's a freaking mushroom, dude. There are different kinds of sea sponges, but just compare this [sea sponge](https://i.imgur.com/YOrcnUI.jpg) to this [mushroom](https://i.imgur.com/aRdLjih.jpg). Or this captivating [sea sponge](https://i.imgur.com/298NcyX.jpg) to this delightful [mushroom](https://i.imgur.com/c2NPTit.jpg). Another [sea sponge](https://i.imgur.com/DwuSAja.jpg) and [mushroom](https://i.imgur.com/DuR5u6I.jpg) for you. If that wasn't enough, there exists a fungus so reminiscent to sea sponges that scientists named it after the most famous sea sponge in history -- [Spongiforma squarepantsii](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spongiforma_squarepantsii). That's real. I'm handing out mid-tier quality TILs for free here. We could go on about other fungal-looking invertebrate animals, such as [bryozoa](https://i.imgur.com/RbRTMva.jpg) or [sea anemones](https://i.imgur.com/PyME9OX.jpg), but I think I've made my point.

&#x200B;

**VI. Dinosaurs**

After the [K-T extinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event#Terrestrial_plants) exterminated the dinosaurs and blackened the skies, fungi allowed life to continue: in only a few years, fungi, not requiring photosynthesis to thrive, consumed Earth's dying plantlife and dominated the globe in a massive fungal bloom. Not only did this recycle the planet's nutrients, but [cold-blooded reptiles, significantly more prone to fungal infections than warm-blooded mammals, were obliterated](https://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/m_features/fungi-are-responsible-for-life-on-land-as-we-know-it). What's the relevance here? My point is that fungi have proven tougher than their fellow eukaryotes, the plants and animals. Fungi hit the reset button.

&#x200B;

**VII. Aliens**

Okay, let's be honest: we both know, intuitively, that fungi are aliens. Isn't that something you already believe, deep down? Look at any mushroom. I typed ""fantasy alien landscape"" into Google Images and [this](https://i.imgur.com/f8Y3A7T.jpg) was the first result. But let's go deeper.

[Giant mushrooms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototaxites) once towered over all life. This could not possibly be more alien. Why didn't I know about this? Did you? Check out this [scientific illustration](https://i.imgur.com/LAHSzJc.jpg) of these obviously alien overseers. That's a real scientific depiction of what Earth really looked like. Search for ""Prototaxites"" online and check out the illustrations.

Fungi are capable of mind control. [Ophiocordyceps unilateralis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophiocordyceps_unilateralis) is an fungus which infects carpenter ants and turns them into zombies, hijacking their brains and bodies for the bidding of its fungal master. An infected ant will leave its nest, chomp down on a leaf, and remain there until death. Days later, a [mushroom will pierce out of the ant's skull](https://i.imgur.com/BSlRDHN.jpg), which will proliferate spores in order to find new hosts to infect. Wherever you find fungi, you find science fiction.

Of course magic mushrooms play into this.  Throughout human history, psychedelic mushrooms have been used to commune with a ""higher power,"" from ancient cultures to present day. Prehistoric mushroom paintings can be found on cave walls in Africa. Trips are described as ""cosmic"" and ""time-distorting."" Very extraterrestrial. And now, magic mushrooms are beginning to achieve real traction in the medical community as a [mind-expanding drug that can create permanent improvements in humans](https://www.livescience.com/16287-mushrooms-alter-personality-long-term.html).

What the hell is it going to take to convince you? Remember when I said they can survive outer space? Intergalactic spores, y'all.

I just checked Netflix -- why isn't there a single fungi documentary available for streaming? Why aren't we talking about fungi all the time? There's no shortage of material. Like that the [largest](https://www.businessinsider.com/largest-living-organism-the-armillaria-ostoyae-fungus-2017-5) living thing is a fungus. And the [fastest](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/fastest-accelerating-organism-earth-fungus/) thing. It feels secretive. But isn't that the fungi style? Ephemeral, but omnipresent. Always above, always below. I'm freaking out here.

Humans are really good at killing things, both plants and animals. We've decimated our planet and the Earth is tragically headed toward another mass extinction due to climate change. But we haven't made a dent in the life of fungi. To the contrary, from what I can gather, fungi will thrive as temperatures rise. Fungi have always held the real power over plants and animals. Maybe we're going the way of the dinosaurs. Another reset. Our turn to decompose.

I mean, this year has been pretty crazy, right? Surreal, even."	1	
t3_3qk9ss	CMV: China and India have every right to burn fossil fuels.	"This is simply a human rights issue.  There are billions of people in poverty whose depths we can barely imagine.  These people belong to countries that are undergoing an industrial revolution.  Industrial revolutions will bring these people up to a much more reasonable level of living at the cost of more fossil fuels in our atmosphere.  

It is unfair for the Developed Nations who have already gone through an Industrial Revolution and are already working to reduce carbon output, to point our collective finger at developing nations and say they can't revolutionize their economy to cater to billions in poverty, because it hurts the environment.  

I'm not underplaying the harm of climate change, and not denying that it will disportionally affect poorer countries that aren't as equipped to defend themselves.  But that is still a drop in the bucket compared to China and India, countires that house over two billion people, they have every right to burn fossil fuels and it is unreasonable to ask them to stop now.

Thanks for reading and as always CMV!

t3_obfpgz	CMV: Social Media is Toxic to Society	"It may seem ironic for me to decry social media on a social media site, but I think it's appropriate --

In my opinion, social media has been a horrific accelerator of humankind's worst tendecies, and is toxifying our society.

Chronic judgments, superficial lies, and echo chambers of misinformation have amplified our negativity, as well as distracted many Americans and other members of industrial societies from real crises like Climate Change, World Hunger, Global Peace, or Social Justice.

What I mean is, people online are nasty & carry that nastiness into real life. If you aren't pretty, funny, or witty, no one values you in the digital world & the culture of people who learn this way likewise treat you cruelly in real life.

Even more scary, actual life-or-death needs are tragically ignored by bad info on FaceBook, InstaGram, Twitter, or even Reddit etc. We see vaccine lies lead to people dying ; we also see violent white supremacists organize domestic terror ; and we see junk science like alternate ""climate"" hypotheses spread as though they're scientific theories.

So with so much global ugliness emanating from online, what good is there to the tech of social media?"	1	
t3_2t84tp	"CMV: No major legislation/reforms in the US will be pass in the next 50+ years and we are going to enter a very long period of ""stagnation"""	"And by major legislation I mean any major nation wide issue such as immigration, climate change, automation, minimum wage/living wage, tax reform, health care, wall street reform, education reform, civil rights, etc etc.

You can almost replace ""no major legislation"" with ""no legislation"" but I'm sure minor things such as continuing resolutions  will keep passing as a stopgap to fund the government and a few trade deals will get passed. But that's pretty much it, no matter which democrat wins the white house. Here is the reasoning I have this view.

1. It is impossible for a Republican to ever win the white house, and will continue to be less likely into the future due to urbanization and minority demographics.

2. It is impossible for democrats to ever control 60% of the senate and the majority of the house ever again due to demographics and geography of districts and rural states.

3. It is impossible for the Republican base and Republican politicians to moderate over time due to the prevalence of media/internet and the continuous feedback loop of propaganda. For example, the recent ""no go zones"" debacle. This is still being repeated in right wing circles.

4. Because of items 1 to 3, it is impossible to amend the constitution to get money out of politics.

Ok there is is, lay it on me. CMV. And just saying something like ""well, you're right but i'll be 40 years instead of 50 years"" does not really challenge my view."	1	
t3_8o0szc	CMV: The EU should abolish intensive animal farming by 2030	"\* There is a growing consensus, in ethics and in the general population,  
that factory farmed meat is highly problematic \(for various reasons,

between what people have reason to believe and how they act.  
\* Currently, we ""privatize"" this problem and hope for consumerism to  
solve it, while what is needed is structural, political change.  
\* It is a political task to ban goods that are harmful to the community.

t3_1a6wgu	"I think moral vegetarianism is wrong and maybe even pointless, CMV"	"Talking about the abstention from eating meat, though veganism is worse, IMO. A few things that I think bolster my current position:

* [~~The meat industry mostly processes a quota of meat based on livestock that they breed for the express purpose of breeding more livestock, or being killed or used for food. Not eating meat might hurt their profit margin, but the animals will still be killed, either by humans or other animals if released, so there's no reduction in suffering.~~](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1a6wgu/i_think_moral_vegetarianism_is_wrong_and_maybe/c8un929)

* Plants might be capable of feeling pain, in which case it defeats what I think is the main reason one would choose vegetarianism. It's hypocritical to condemn pain caused in animals but openly condone pain caused to plants by encouraging their consumption.

* Even if plants feel no pain, that doesn't mean we can't cause them suffering. Certainly [in humans](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Congenital_insensitivity_to_pain), lack of pain doesn't justify doing harm to the individual, so it fails to solve the moral quandary even if pain were a non-issue.

* ~~[Agriculture may cause up to a million animal deaths each year](http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=97836&page=1), in which case a vegetarian diet also relies on the death of animals to enable it.~~Thanks [sbuddh](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1a6wgu/i_think_moral_vegetarianism_is_wrong_and_maybe/c8uq325).

t3_57oe2z	Cmv: stealing meat is better overall for animal welfare than buying vegetables.	"I lean towards vegetarianism. I came across a quote (the title) that i found really interesting.

When you buy meat, youre choosing to support the inexcusable abuse of tens of billions of animals every year in factory farms. 

But when you buy vegetables youre giving  money to people who will then likely spend it on meat (as well as a host of other unethical things like sweatshop labr and fossil fuels etc). Every dollar is a unit of power an youre giving that to people who will use it to fund causes that harm animals.

So from a vegetarians perspective its actually better to eat stolen meat than it is to eat vegetables you paid for."	1	
t3_70thl7	CMV: Debates cannot contribute to a controversial topic.	"True, having two sides presenting their arguments and defending them is a great way to learn how to make arguments, support it with reasoning and evidence and spot logical fallacies. But what is it worth beyond this? 

My opinion is that there is none. Because of how a debate works, neither side could possibly come to a conclusion or contribute to a topic as they have incentive to do whatever it takes to persuade the audience that their side if right, even if it might not be the case. Even if a debater thinks his opponent is persuasive, he cannot concede his point in fear of losing the argument.

What different is this, compared to the ignorant voter who will not be persuaded by scientific evidence and logical reasoning? Debating is like arguing with him: Even if you make sense, he will not change his mind, nor will you accomplish anything. The audience may be persuaded by you - but isn't this more easily done through a format that is not a debate, like an article or a speech? And is it even possible to sway an audience, who may not be skillful enough to evaluate the scenario, and may think an one-sided debated is actually 50/50?

I'm sure you have seen debates on controversial topics, like those surrounding climate change. Deniers will often bring up fallacious arguments, or ones that are already proven wrong many times. They will often criticize scientific evidence as biased, while bringing up even less credible evidence or no evidence at all. Even if they make no sense, they sound like they're infallible. To the public, this gives the false pretense that climate change is something still not agreed upon, while the truth is that climate change deniers are a very small portion of people who refuse scientific consensus.

One often mentioned upside to debates is that it allows two sides to exchange opinions. Then, is it not better to do it through a conversation and not a formal debate? In an conversation, it is completely acceptable to concede a point, change one's mind, and learn about the other side. Hell, even this subreddit has a rule that promotes conversations and not debating. I think this rule and /r/changemyview's ability to actually change viewpoints proves my point - conversations evolve topics, not debates.

So, are formal debates really something we want to show to the public? Shouldn't we want to present truth in a more authoritative way, or present arguments in a more conversational way?

I know my argument isn't flawless - and I'm happy to discuss this topic. (And yes, I had unpleasant experiences with debates.)

t3_3gys03	CMV: The George W. Bush years (2000-2008) will be perceived by future generations as a dark age in world history.	"If any of you frequent /r/badhistory, there is a rather infamous [chart](http://i.imgur.com/zbue8vU.jpg) that captures a popular perception of the Middle Ages as a ""dark age"" that retarded scientific progress by over 1,000 years. This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:

The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.

Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.

Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.

Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.

Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that ""the rise of the rest"" has been an utter illusion.

Erosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony ""development"" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.

TL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.

t3_2w2zt5	CMV: There are other forms of life in the universe besides human beings	"I find the possibility of life outside of Earth an undeniable fact. In short, the universe is too enormous to contain only one planet sustainable of housing life. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), as of 2-12-15, there are 1,814 confirmed exoplanets which have been spotted outside of our solar system, meaning if only 1% of these planets are suitable for human life, it leaves almost 20 habitable planets just within view from Earth alone. Even with these twenty planets, there could be hundreds, if not thousands, which already have a form of life occupying them who do not need Earth-like conditions to live and are outside of our viewing limitations. Just thinking of how vast the universe is, I find it inconceivable to believe Earth is the only planet capable of sustaining life. Change my view.

t3_26dppw	"CMV: The Law of Unintended Consequences makes me question supporting ""active"" solutions."

For instance, those who claim that raising the minimum wage or mandating health care will result in jobs being and harming the people the action was intended to help.

Other arguments can be made for environmentalists who protest nuclear power which results in more coal being burnt, or educational policies that result in decreases in educational quality.

Now, I firmly believe that action is better than inaction, and that we have a duty to try to fix the problems that we see in the world.  You don't need to change my view about that.

But when we take action in an extremely complex world, we run the risk of increasing world suck instead of decreasing it.  That being the case, I feel very conflicted between my desire to do something and the knowledge that I might cause harm.

What I'm looking for is a reason to believe that the Law is overblown, and is generally supported by flimsy anecdotes rather than being a reason to believe that more harm than good is done by well intentioned intervention.

t3_4fs1ce	CMV: The Middle East will erupt into war against us (the western world) when their oil is no longer required.	"I'm going to preface this by saying I'm not an expert on the current situation of oil in the Middle East, and honestly I wouldn't even call myself that informed. Hence why I want my view changed or reinforced, depending on how close to the truth it is.

From what I understand, the Middle East is a major exporter of oil, as is stated [here](http://www.opec.org/opec_web/en/data_graphs/330.htm), where 81% of oil comes from mostly Middle Eastern countries. Another website [here](http://euanmearns.com/oil-exports-from-the-middle-east-and-the-price-of-oil/) states that the ""[...] equivalent to 22.6% of total global oil production and 43% of OECD oil consumption"" comes from there.

The Middle East is also a war-riddled area, riddled with conflict and non-western-friendly ideologies and beliefs. When the day comes that the western world moves to renewable energy cars (such as [hydrogen fuel cells](http://www.ucsusa.org/clean-vehicles/electric-vehicles/how-do-hydrogen-fuel-cells-work), which are [set to become a lot more common when the technology catches up](http://www.ourenergypolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/fulfilling-the-potential-of-fuel-cell-vehicles-fact-sheet.pdf)), income to these countries will plummet and their main export will become useless. At this time I believe they will blame the countries that moved on to more renewable technologies and start a more fully fledged, all-or-nothing war against us using whatever arsenal they have.

So yeah, CMV. I've been doing a lot of thinking about this and this is the only reasonable explanation I can think of, besides them somehow changing their ways and becoming westernised. I'm not for a second saying I want this to happen, it's just the scenario I've thought up."	1	
t3_6g5udf	CMV: nuclear needs to be part of a post-carbon energy mix.	"I'm not well-informed on this topic, so sources from which I can learn are appreciated. 

I think it's a given that we need ideally to reduce, or at the very least to stabilize, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere. And that, in turn, means a drastic move away from petroleum, natural gas, etc. But problems with storage and production capacity mean that it's exceedingly difficult to replace them with renewables exclusively. (Disclosure: I volunteer with a group devoted to reducing atmospheric carbon.) 

So why not crack some rocks to supplement? Yes, expensive to build and some risk to operate, but cheap power and much, much lower risk with new-gen designs. I admit that some existing plants are just too old and dangerous to run, but that's not a compelling argument for closing all or against new construction. 

Also, since I'm anonymous, I'll just say it: maybe the risk is worth it. Three Mile Island, Chernobyl and Fukushima combined killed fewer people than fossil fuel emissions kill in a year. 

Open to CMV though!



After all these well thought-out answers, I have to admit that I'm even more ambivalent, in the sense of simultaneously holding two opposing viewpoints that are now even stronger. 

The arguments that are resonating most with me are that renewable storage is coming along, and that the construction lead times run to decades, at which point renewables may be able to provide a greater share of the mix. 

I still don't have enough information on the dangers of extraction, mining, etc. I get that it's a dirty, yucky process, but I don't understand the scale of it. Does nuclear actually require MORE mining than the rare earths and other raw materials required for renewables?

t3_3r6gim	CMV: Im not wrong for thinking everyone (who's reading this) should be a vegetarian. It is undeniable the vegetarianism is ethically superior to eating meat.	"So i've been a vegetarian for about 6 months or so and its weird how much obnoxious anti-vego sentiment there is among meat eaters.

Im not saying I think less of people who eat meat and (most of my friends do) and im not saying being a vego instantly makes you better than meat eaters, vegetarians can be cunts too.

But if you eat meat, there is a huge likelihood that you support factory farming and contribute to the abuse of billions of animals every year, as well as contributing to massive deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. 

Vegetarianism is *clearly* more ethically and environmentally responsible than eating meat, and its way easier and cheaper than boycotting other abusive industries like those that profit from sweatshop labour, so there is not really any excuse not to do it other than liking the taste of big macs more than you care about animal abuse and the environment.

Im not saying I should be preachy or ever bother to try and talk people into it, but I dont get why meat eaters have so much difficulty accepting that its less ethical and more environmentally irresponsible.

t3_2i3me7	CMV: Environmental regulations don't have a negative impact on a country's economy in the long term	"Environmental regulation does two main things. 

	
1) Maintains the environment contained within a country to an acceptable standard. While this has a nice ""feel good"" component to it, the true value  lies with protecting natural assets from costly cleanup and healthcare costs. China is the quintessential example. For years they maximized the value of their resources for export and domestic use, without many environmental restraints. While this was a major boon for them in the short run, the long term health impacts of their choices and the discouragement of foreign workers and visitors will surely result in a net negative in the long run. If your country becomes a toxic, smog filled mess, people won't want to visit or work there. (Also, I don't want to seem overly disparaging of China, I know it's a huge country and not every part is like Beijing.) It is always far easier to control pollution on the production side than it is to remediate later. Institutional controls and engineering controls put in place on the front end of design and policy making are always cheaper than trying to clean up a mess later.
	

2) The other charge that is usually railed against environmental regulation is that enforcement and compliance is a drain on the economy. The truth is that the regulation is a drain only on the individual companies that are required to comply with the regulations. The money spent on compliance doesn't vanish into thin air, rather it simply shifts profits from one company to environmental consulting companies and their associated infrastructure. Between construction contracts for remediation work, environmental professionals, environmental laboratories, laboratory supply companies, etc etc. The money from company A gets sent to companies B-G. So long as they are all domestic and contained within the same economy, the ""net"" doesn't really change. The other argument would be that the more regulations you have, the more government workers are needed for monitoring and compliance. But from working in the industry, I can assure you that the average division has a very low employee/project ratio (meaning a few regulators monitor a ton of sites), and if anything, the govt side is understaffed. The recent high profile spills have shed light on the fact that the EPA is way way behind on toxicity characterizations of industry chemicals. This is why when the spill in West Virginia occurred, all they could say was: don't contact the water, we don't know what this chemical does to humans. But more importantly, the ""bigger the industry, bigger the govt"" argument is applicable to all branches of public safety. The bigger the city, the more public services. The bigger a certain food industry is, the more USDA and FDA workers you  need. 
	
	
I'm definitely open to new ideas. In terms of discourse, if you have no business experience, environmental experience, or any sort of actual experience in the nature of these industries and their impact on economies, please avoid wanton politically charged conjecture. I'm interested in learning about actual demonstrable economic reasons why having a high level of environmental regulation is negative in the long term.

For sake of clarification, lets define ""long term"" to mean 50-100 years. Barring a worldwide catastrophe, I don't think it's that unreasonable to expect most of the big countries that are extant today to still be clucking around in 50 years.

t3_5h38nr	"CMV: Global free trade is a practical and ethical policy, and the recent populist backlash against it in Europe and the United States is misguided."	"Let me preface this by saying that I am not an economist, but I accept the consensus among those who are, arguing that free trade increases efficiency and total wealth, and that the purpose of trade policy is to produce wealth. I also accept John Rawls' arguments in A Theory of Justice, that a just society is one that offers equal basic liberty, actual equality of opportunity, and where the arrangement of society is to the greatest benefit of the least advantaged member of society. It might seem that the Rawls' radical egalitarianism is in direct conflict with free trade, but I reject the argument that free trade leads inexorably to inequality. 

It is the purpose of government, through redistribution, to equitably divide resources in such a way that is of greatest advantage to the least advantaged member of society. It follows then that any policy which increases the total efficiency of the economy is not merely preferable, but in fact a necessity to create a just society, because the more resources available in toto, the more resources will be available to the least advantaged member of society if they are divided equally. Insofar as globalized market capitalism is capable of creating enough wealth for society as a whole that the least advantaged member of society is better served by it than by an alternative arrangement, globalized market capitalism is a just form of economic organization. This, I believe, is what Smith meant in the Wealth of Nations when he wrote:


Ignoring for a moment the unfashionable Whiggishness and the obvious (and indefensible) colonialism, it strikes me that this sentiment is precisely that of Rawls' ""to the advantage of the least advantaged member of society"". The inequality of the prince to the day-laborer is justified because the day-laborer is better served by a market economy than he would be by the absence of a market economy. 

But of course a globalized market economy does not mean an unlimited or unregulated market economy. Where such economic regulations produce greater gains in efficiency than the market, those regulations are justified by precisely the same logic: increasing total efficiency is good for everyone because a sufficiently larger pie makes even the smallest slice larger. Put another way, just economic regulation is addressed to increasing Pareto Efficiency by overcoming various market failures (monopoly/monopsony, asymmetric and imperfect organization, transaction costs, etc.). Hence, the Coase Theorem: in a world without transaction costs etc., legal property entitlements are irrelevant because the parties will bargain to the same result. 
Apologies for the long set-up of something that I think is not extraordinarily controversial, and thanks to any readers still sticking with me, but I feel it is a good practice to spell out these underlying normative assumptions lest we start talking past each other. So accepting all of the above, the central questions are: 

1. Does hampering the international movement of capital, human capital, natural resources, and goods in some way overcome some number of market failures and therefore approach closer to a (constrained) Pareto optimum?

2. Does allowing unrestricted international movement of same in some way create market failures?

3. Does allowing unrestricted international movement of same produce inequality of basic rights, inequality of opportunity, or material inequality not to the advantage of the least advantaged member of society (and therefore results in injustice), and if so what policies are called for? 

I suggest that the answer to these questions is No, Not exactly, and Yes, but that the correct response to increase redistributive policy not to halt free trade, for the following reasons. 

The first answer is, I think, fairly self-explanatory. Free trade lowers transaction costs and therefore makes it less costly to approach a constrained Pareto efficiency on a global as well as national scale. Imposing costs on trade makes it more costly to approach a constrained Pareto efficiency. It is not a market failure for places with cheaper labor to manufacture things using raw materials from places with abundant natural resources and capital from elsewhere, etc. even though the result of that might be to increase unemployment or decrease wages elsewhere; rather, that is a failure of equal justice as divorced from the market (see point three). This is not to say that all regulation of a global market is bad, either. There may be market failures in a global market that still need to be addressed (e.g. human beings routinely engage in hyperbolic discounting of future costs, whether due to cognitive bias or incomplete information etc., leading to overconsumption of resources even absent a tragedy of the commons-type problem) but these market failures aren't in any way prevented by barriers to trade. 

The second question is close to the reverse of the first: namely, whatever market failures that might be existing are not created by free trade any more than they are prevented by mercantilism. However, the astute reader will notice that I qualified my answer with ""not exactly"", because I recognize that because globalism involves multiple nations, multilateral institutional arrangements, no clear sovereign, etc. market failures might be more costly to address in a global free trade setting for institutional reasons. Thus conceivably gains in Pareto efficiency might be more constrained in a global market than a domestic one. I don't think that this is ultimately the case based on my admittedly limited research, but even assuming it arguendo, that situation would speak to the need to create stronger and more efficient international institutions (and thus lower transaction costs and remove such constraints on Pareto optimization) rather than to the need to withdraw from the global market and engage in isolationism or protectionism. 

Finally, it strikes me that globalized free trade obviously increases inequality, both of actual opportunity and materially, and that its effects on the equality of basic freedoms is far from clear; however, I would again point out that inequality is not necessarily a market failure, but a political one. I strongly support the redistribution of wealth from those to whom the gains of globalized markets predominantly flow to those who face pressure from increasing and more perfect competition. There is a real human cost that globalized markets entail for a significant minority, and the anger over that cost has been ignored by governments for too long (resulting in the fundamentally misguided rise of populist support in the West). It is also, to me at least, obviously the case that the ""meritocracy"" of the global elite is entirely self-perpetuating. The advantages of a child whose parents have the good fortune of wealth and power in terms of opportunity are incalculable. This is not actual equality of opportunity, and so there needs to be serious expansion of education, health, and welfare programs as well as more liberal understandings of economic affirmative action and what constitutes ""merit"" in place to address that. The notion that free trade will lead to democratization and respect for equal basic rights around the world also seems to be more of a fervent hope than an empirical fact, and rising inequality can threaten equal basic rights (see, e.g., the effects of Citizens United on free speech rights). However, there doesn't seem to be any reason at all to think that refusing to engage in commerce has any real effect on promoting democratization and respect for basic rights either (see, e.g., the lack of positive effects of turning the DPRK into a pariah state, the totally ineffective and now hopefully done for good US embargo on Cuba), and the forces of isolation and reaction emboldened and encouraged by the rising populist protectionist movements in the West (rising hate crimes in the US after Trump's election, assassination of MP Jo Cox during the Brexit campaign, far-right parties throughout Continental Europe, etc.) seem to pose a significant and immediate threat to equal basic liberties that ought not to be underestimated. So maybe we can call the equal basic rights effects a wash. 

Therefore, it is my contention that Free Trade is not merely practical, but that there is in fact an ethical imperative to both engage wholeheartedly and efficiently in global free trade and to ensure that its benefits are distributed justly throughout society by engaging in focused redistributive practices. I truly welcome any and all arguments in opposition, and thank you if you managed to get through this long post!

t3_50es8q	CMV: We should reduce the corporate income tax in the U.S to 10-15%	"The corporate income tax is quite politically popular because there is a very negative stigma around large businesses/corporations.

Few Americans believe corporate income taxes have a negative impact on them. After all, if they don't own stocks, and they aren't wealthy, why should they care that the greedy corporations that treat employees poorly get taxed?

What many Americans don't realize is that the corporate tax has a negative impact on job creation, and reduced job creation has a negative impact on wages.

By having such a high corporate tax, corporations in the U.S have an incentive to keep capital out of the U.S. This means jobs created in other countries or avoided altogether. Profits made overseas are almost never brought over, which means these taxes aren't even paid, anyways. So we're destroying jobs while receiving no benefit in return, as most of our corporate taxes come from smaller corporations that can't afford to globalize their business.

For corporations that do pay a fair amount of corporate taxes(mainly smaller corporations), these taxes reduce the amount of capital that can be reinvested in order to create jobs.

What many Americans don't think about is where corporations' money and capital from profits actually goes. Either it gets sent out in dividend payments to the shareholders(who we could be taxing the capital gains of at a higher rate rather than taxing corporate profits), or it gets reinvested in job creation or other expenditures that stimulate the economy.

When you create jobs through lower corporate taxation and regulation, you also simultaneously increase wages. When you increase the supply of available jobs, you increase competition between employers for workers. Thus, when there is a surplus of available jobs, employers end up having to pay more and more to adequately staff their business. As a result, more Americans are employed, and many of them make more money.

**The result of reducing the capital gains tax is that you effectively creation millions of high paying jobs through reducing the incentive to evade taxes, increasing available capital for corporations to invest, and reducing wasteful spending on tax accountants and lawyers that serve the sole purpose of fighting the system of taxation**

**Addressing common opposition**

The first opposition to this is that we need the money, and can't afford to cut it. However, [corporate income tax counts for just 10% of U.S Federal government revenue](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/briefing-book/what-are-sources-revenue-federal-government-0)

By cutting corporate taxes,we also increase the incentive to evade taxation. By achieving one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world, we will become the world's new tax shelter, resulting in trillions of dollars being taxed(although at a lower rate) here rather than elsewhere. Essentially, corporate tax rates are a form of competition, businesses will chase where they're lowest, alongside other factors like infrastructure.

In addition to this, eliminating corporate income tax will drive up tax income elsewhere. Through job creation and higher wages, personal income taxes will increase, providing more government revenue.

The only people that would be hurt by eliminating the corporate income tax is the corporate tax accountants/lawyers that are paid huge amounts of money to figure out how to reduce their tax liability.

Even if you hate the rich, corporations, and all things capitalistic, I believe it's illogical to oppose reducing corporate income taxes, because such a thing would result in more government funding for social welfare programs and public spending through increased output that is taxed through other methods. If you truly hate the rich, you should be in favor of increasing capital gains taxes on the wealthy, while simultaneously reducing corporate taxes."	1

t3_91o89x	CMV: Big Corporations can be just as damaging to society as Big Government	"I came here because I’m openly willing to have my mind changed. 

I don’t really know too much about either of these to consider myself to have an expert view and thus, I’m very willing to have my mind changed if I’m approached reasonably and from a rational and factual standpoint. 

I know that in fundamental definitions, big corporations and big government aren’t the same at all, but I do believe that they have a vey much comparable negative effect on our society.

I just get confused when people make the argument against big government but support a free unregulated market and business model with big corporations. Because just like in practice big governments have shown to be dangerous, in practice the big corporations that are part of the “free market” here in the USA have shown to have as much bureaucracy, dirty politics, and power-hungry controlling habits as people like to claim the government has.

I just feel like arguing between small government with a free unregulated market vs a big government is a game of “let’s pick the tyranny that’s hidden under a veil over the same tyranny that is just more obvious”. 

I believe human institutions with too much power are a dangerous thing. Religion, government, corporations... So I don’t understand how people who make claims against big government support big corporations and an unregulated market. 

I had someone once make the argument “because in a free unregulated market you have the ability to simply choose another option”, I really don’t think this rings true in practice, especially for lower classes and people that are not as affluent. And I think it assumes not only that everyone has the privilege to choose another option, but also that everyone had the wisdom to choose another option. Neither of which is true, and a free market is a place where the decisions of others affect that you see and hear about the most. 

If anyone could give a better run down of what big government truly means and free unregulated market truly means then that would help strengthen or change my view. I’m truly open to learn more about this because it is a strong feeling I have from my knowledge of the world but not a view I can strongly defend when confronted with technicalities. If anyone also disagrees then I am willing to see and understand why, and maybe I’ll have my mind changed!

t3_drf37q	CMV: climate protesters do more harm than good by blocking traffic	"I would understand if they were bringing attention to a heinous issue that few people actually know about but literally every knows about climate change.

I really do not understand the thinking behind the numerous Extinction Rebellion protests around the world that involve blocking traffic and shutting down busy city streets. It seems like overall it would turn people against them and create resentment and disdain for all environmental protests. How does making people late for work help the climate?

100 companies cause 70% of emissions. The problem is caused by a very small handful of powerful people. Shouldn’t XR be pressuring people who actually have the power to change things rather than fucking with random people?"	1	
t3_955jfy	CMV: Thorium is the future of energy	"As global warming continues, humanity will need to change the way we get most of our power. If we don't, we risk our coastal cities flooding, mass extinction, and when oil starts to run out, it will lead to chaos. We need to switch to a renewable energy that can last us a long time, as well as being practical and hopefully clean. The answer to the current energy crisis is thorium power. But before I get started on that, let me explain why solar, wind and hydro are not feasible for the future of energy production worldwide. Starting with solar and wind, they both have the same problem: they cannot run when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing, respectively. (and no, you cannot store energy on a large scale because no technology exists that can do that) This is a problem called the ducks curve, and if we follow through with the solar and wind craze, we won't have power at night. Since you cannot turn off and on a nuclear plant or coal/fossil fuel plant, this creates a massive problem in using solar and wind tech for our main source of energy in the future. What about hydro, though? The problem here is very obvious, and it's that hydro itself does not produce that much energy, as well as not every country has a large network of rivers. Hydro works great for countries that have massive rivers in abundance, but is useless if you live out somewhere in the desert. (just want to point out fusion is still unproven, and at this point seems like more of just a pipe dream to me)

So what are our alternatives? We have been repeatedly told that these three renewable can stop the energy crisis we are facing, but that dream is not very realistic. If you don't know what thorium is, then let me give you a brief explanation. Thorium power is a nuclear technology, which is clean, safe, abundant, and produces huge amounts of power. I know that to some people, nuclear is scary. It conjures up visions of nuclear wastelands and images of three mile island, fukushima, and chernobyl. But before you start making assumptions about thorium power, let me dispel those thoughts.

1.) First of all, thorium plants are completely safe. You see, thorium is ""fertile"", meaning it needs to have a helper material to react. This may seem like a disadvantage at first, but when you think about it, its a lot safer. If something goes wrong in the plant, the thorium is just drained away from the helper material, and a crisis is averted. Uranium, on the other hand, is fissile, which means it can just keep going by itself. This is a bad thing of you want to cool down the uranium, because it will just keep going, and a melt down occurs. 

2.) Thorium is clean for the environment. In traditional nuclear plants, most of the uranium fuel rods are wasted. Only a small percentage of the actual fuel is used, and the leftover stuff (generalizing a bit here) is the waste. This means we generate lots of waste, and also are losing lots of power. However, in thorium reactors, most of the fuel is used, and the waste that is generated can be reprocessed to create even more power. At the end of the process, the leftover waste is not that large, and can be kept in a remote area. But just as a side bonus, the waste generated by these plants will diminish in 500 years, which may seem like awhile, but in geological terms is very short.

Just so this post doesn't become to long, I've decided to stop here. I could go on and on about the benefits of thorium, but that would turn into a post the size of a textbook. If you have any questions feel free to ask.  

 Also, just note I'm talking about the LFTR design of thorium reactors, not the solid fuel stuff so don't ask about that. Any responses are appreciated, thanks."	1	
t3_5wkqg2	CMV: I don't respect meat-eaters as much as non-meat-eaters.	"I'm just gonna be upfront. You can try to change my opinion about vegetarianism as a whole, but I very much doubt that as the facts are against you. I won't change my view that vegetarianism is a good thing unless you prove animals aren't conscious, global warming doesn't exist, and meat is cheap and healthy. 

What you should do is change my mind as to why I should respect meat-eaters as much as vegetarians and the like. Why is it ethically 'ok' for you to eat meat as an individual? This also goes along the lines about how I think its ethical for me to be as many like to call it ""militant."" I actually am pretty damn libertarian (vs authoritarian) but on this issue I don't like allowing others to do what they want.


I'm going to leave the reasons for going vegetarian brief so I can delve more into counter-arguing the common arguments I see against vegetarianism. (Ask for sources if you want but this is pretty readily found info.)
1) Ethical
50+ billion animals died from factory farming each year. If you value animals lives as anything over 0, even something like 1/10000 of a person, you would still care a LOT.
2) Environmental
Factory farming is 50% the cause of C02 emissions leading to global warming.
3) Economical
Plant foods are cheaper on a micro and macro scale, meaning as an individual they are cheaper and that if they were produced on mass scale rather than meat, more than half a billion more people could be fed.

I don't really wanna talk about health things some I'm gonna leave that out. This isn't because I don't know about the health: I know almost all the nutrients you need, even the lesser known ones, and if you really wanna talk about it I will. I just don't want to make this a CMV about the health effects. I know that the health benefits may only be because vegans live healthier in general, but I doubt it.


Common counter arguments:

**""People need meat.""**
Well, I did a change my view over this a while ago and everyone there seemed to agree that it is a FACT that you don't need meat, so I really don't want to talk about this again.

**“Animals aren’t worthy of moral consideration.”**
We should ask ourselves for a moment what makes a life worthy of moral consideration. Most would say sentience, or the ability to suffer, is that determining factor:

“The absence of a neocortex does not appear to preclude an organism from experiencing affective states. Convergent evidence indicates that non-human animals have the neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and neurophysiological substrates of conscious states along with the capacity to exhibit intentional behaviors. Consequently, the weight of evidence indicates that humans are not unique in possessing the neurological substrates that generate consciousness. Non-human animals, including all mammals and birds, and many other creatures, including octopuses, also possess these neurological substrates” - Cambridge Declaration On Consciousness.

Animals are conscious to feelings of pleasure and pain.

Let’s say for a moment that even after reading this, we say animals are only worth a ten-thousandth of a human - that’s 10,000 individual animals compared to one person - the animals slaughtered each year would be representable as a holocaust-size amount each year.
http://fcmconference.org/img/CambridgeDeclarationOnConsciousness.pdf

**“Meat is delicious.”**
If taste is really what is most valued above all else, spend more time or money for meals… An increase in time and money for a meal objectively increases at least the potential for taste. However, this is not to say a vegetarian meal can’t be both delicious, cheap, and quick. Rice, pasta, and legumes are cheaper than meat.

They are plenty of vegetarian foods that are equivalent on the taste scale with meat, and if you really still want the taste of meat, go buy mock meat. As more research is put into mock meat, it can taste closer and closer to the real thing. As for anything, some vegetarian burgers are good, some are bad. Some dishes are healthier than others, etc. Going vegetarian does not mean salads every night... or ever.
Another thing to note: there are plenty of foods on the planet people have no tried, so go try more if variety sounds great.

The argument really isn't about taste. It's about ease of access and how in our culture grocery stores and restaurants offer so much and only meat, which isn't even a problem with vegetarianism, but a problem with our culture.

Even if you're gonna say you can't live without that specific taste, even if you probably haven't tried new foods, is that simple gluttonous behavior really worth all this other stuff? Is it ethical to do things just for quick pleasure (insert obvious analogies here)?

**“What about plant rights?” - Slippery slope**
This argument is usually used in two ways. Sometimes, it’s used as a joke to show how vegetarianism is ridiculous. Other times, it’s used to argue that granting animal rights would lead to plant rights in the future.

To address the first use of the argument, plants rights and animals rights are not analogous; plants do experience “pain” but humans and other animals experience qualia, while plants do not. Animals are worthy of moral consideration not simply because they are living organisms, rather that they experience pleasure and pain.

For the second use, let’s, for just a moment, ignore how this argument is faulty as it is a fallacy of the slippery slope variety - just because people are advocating for animals rights does not mean that in the future they will push for plant rights. The real question is: what relevance does the subject of plant rights have to do with whether it is ethical or beneficial to eat animals.
Obviously, human lives are worth more than other mammal lives, and those mammal lives are worth more than plant lives and those lives are worth more than microbe lives. See below for ""continuum fallacy.""

**“It’s natural to eat meat.” - Appeal to nature**
Humans aren’t naturally herbivores, but they aren’t naturally carnivores either. Humans get sick if they eat raw meat, they don’t have claws, and they don’t have the canines predators have for tearing into flesh.

Humans’ prehistoric diet, be it herbivorous or carnivorous, does not matter. An appeal to what is or was natural has no relevance on whether abstaining from meat is ethical or healthy. There is a key difference between natural and healthy/optimal.

**“Animals die from vegetable farming equipment anyway.” - See continuum fallacy below**
The idea of vegetarianism is to minimize suffering, not end it. Ending it is not possible. The undocumented and assuredly smaller amount of animals that die in farming equipment is not equatable to the 50 billion that die each year in animal factory farms. Not to mention, most of the vegetable produce is going to feed the animals... so everyone going vegetarian would minimize the deaths from farming equipment too.

**“Carnivores eat prey in the wild.”**
Again, the idea of vegetarianism is to minimize suffering, not end it. Carnivores need to meat to survive; humans don’t. Non-human animals are not sapient, and they can not have debates over whether it is ethical to eat other animals. Otherwise stated as, humans are moral agents.

**“Humans are the top of the food chain.”**
So something more powerful than something else has the right to abuse it? Physically stronger people should not harass others just because they can. We are sapient humans and we do not need to hurt other beings.

**""Jobs would be lost.""**
Yes... This is what happens when industries change. There would be more plant farmers, etc.

**""What about sweat shops?""**
You can't ~~walk and chew gum at the same time~~ do two things at once? That's so irrelevant.

**""If we stopped to consume meat that would be disastrous for multiple animal species because where would they go?""**
That's why we breed less and less... It's not like this would happen overnight anyway.

**""Morals are subjective."" - Argument to moderation**
Obviously some decisions are better than others. Not killing a person is better than killing one and I bet you care about a lot of your fellow humans. We live in real world here, not to mention that this statement is a paradox because if all morals are subjective that statement is also subjective.
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_fallacy
Explains it better:
http://lesswrong.com/lw/mm/the_fallacy_of_gray/

Can we please not get into a giant discussion over the ""morals are subjective"" thing? Its obviously a rationalization. You can't just wisk away animal rights with that statement because you don't 'feel' like they're worth anything unlike humans.

Alright, CMV.

t3_2ri1zm	CMV: I think the idea of a life after death is far more frightening than simply ceasing to exist	"As frightening as it is to think that nothing comes after death, at least that would also means no more suffering and pain. The afterlife on the other hand could be far worse than our wildest imaginations.

Just consider what terrible things are happening in this world, who knows what could happen in the world to come. In this world, suffering has a limit, which is death. No matter how much you are tortured, at some point you die. Even decades of suffering eventually end with death from old age. In the afterlife, suffering could be eternal.

Or imagine being a ghost, a consciousness without a body. Watching the world, but never being able to interact with it. For eternity. No sleep, no rest, no way out.

t3_c749ln	CMV: Hitting the IPCC's carbon emissions target is going to be impossible	"According to the IPCC, in order to limit global warming to 2C, we need to reduce carbon emissions to 2 tons/person per year by 2050.  The average American is currently responsible for 24 tons/year, which means we need to reduce our emissions by over 90%.

For context, here's the current breakdown of an average American's carbon footprint:

https://i2.wp.com/shrinkthatfootprint.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/American-carbon-footprint.gif

With current technology, it looks completely impossible, no matter what you do.  The combination of a vegan-only diet, clothing, and health care already puts you over the limit at 2.6 tons, and that's assuming you live outside, use no energy, never travel, and consume absolutely nothing else.

We obviously need a ton of new technology in order to have any hope of hitting the target, but even in my wildest imagination (100% renewable electricity, 100% electric transportation, 100% electric heating and cooling, etc) it looks like we'd still have no chance to hit 2 tons/person.  Yet, we only have 30 years to get there.

Is the situation really this bleak?  What am I missing here?  I could see a path to cut carbon emissions in half, but 90% just seems impossible."	1

t3_dikytj	CMV: There is no rational reason to attribute any natural disaster to divine punishment.	"This question is **not** about preventable disasters, disasters caused by human incompetence and disasters willingly caused for warfare/terrorism. 

This question is inspired by this comment:


I have to be open to the possibility that just because I disagree with them, I might be wrong and they might be right. But no matter how much I try to think this through, I can't see any rationality to attributing any disaster to divine punishment:

* Natural disasters hit both irreligious and religious areas.
* Natural disasters happen to countries with self-proclaimed ""moral"" laws (e.g. bans on pornography, no gay marriage, difficult to obtain abortions).
* There is no religion that doesn't get hit by natural disasters.
* Natural disasters happened even before gay marriage was invented or promiscuity started increasing.

I asked this question to people I know in real life, and one of the responses I got was ""*religious people getting hit by natural disasters is just God trying to give the message to people who won't refuse to listen*"". But wouldn't that mean that God is killing innocent people to tell a message?

There will be some disasters which will become more frequent and severe due to climate change. But why would it be rational to attribute climate change to divine punishment when there is plenty of evidence that it is caused by human activity (as in greenhouse gas emissions, not gay marriage or abortion)?

Also, before you use the below excuse, please note that I do not deny, ignore or condone atheist atrocities. I just think that they are irrelevant to this question:

t3_69p4a2	CMV:I believe that kids should be able to take an off year (5-12 grade)if they feel they need a break.	"Lots of kids, especially in high school are often stressed with everything going on in their lives. I can speak from experience that having social issues, school work and sports can all be a big weight in the life of a 14-18 year old. I believe that if a kid needs they should be able to take an off year and relax instead of having to deal with all of this stress at once with no break or time to calm down. While it should be regulated to 1 or 2 years per kid, I think it would make a huge difference in the stress levels of teenagers. It would also lower the percent of kids with anxiety and help with school work, as the kids will be able to actually learn the information instead of being overpowered with schoolwork, and having no downtime to actually soak in what they have learned. [25% of teens have some sort of anxiety.](https://www.elementsbehavioralhealth.com/featured/teenagers-are-feeling-more-anxious-than-ever/) It is also shown in college student athletes that taking a gap year between high school and college actually lowers anxiety as well as the risk for burnout.

t3_3c9b4e	"CMV: Greed and other traits associated with ""human nature"" are learned values, not evolutionary ones."	"Disclaimer: socialist here, expect to hear socialist arguments.

The ""human nature"" argument is inherently flawed because ""human nature"" is a social construct. Over time, consciousness, this so called ""human nature"", changes, as it has throughout all of history. Communal villaging preceded serfdom and kingships, serfdom preceded colonialism which in turn preceded capitalism (and of course a ton of other changes in between). All of these events were produced through a change in consciousness of some sort; whether of one class, in allowing for the emergence of a new one, or of society as a whole. Compare the oldest societies with modern ones. Compare their laws and rules and customs. You’ll find massive differences. They’re hardly comparable. But without the long chain of changes and adaptations humans have made throughout history there wouldn't have be any difference. This is why I reject the common insinuation that humans are naturally greedy, competitive and ""capitalist"". I view that as the impression capitalism has left on society, but not as a representation of human nature. Or, if it is, it's subject to constant change and is not the ""end"" stage (tribalism->feudalism->capitalism->end).

More on the tendency of humans to adopt beliefs from society and people around them: just look at how children tend to adopt beliefs and values held by their parents; if you're raised with religious parents chances are you'll remain so and teach your children such. The same is true of political affiliation and just about any other concept or stance on an issue I can think of. By changing our thinking we can affect the thinking of future generations. And this is precisely my point; it's this tendency that most people have to gravitate towards the norm around them or what they’ve been taught that you mistake for human nature; in this case, you're mistaking the influences of generations of living under capitalism as human nature. But your mistaking it for such doesn't make it any more human nature than it is that you may have a predisposition towards >insert< or that your favorite color is >insert<.

Dialectical materialism in a nutshell - people aren't born holding opinions and beliefs, they adopt them based on their experiences and environment. People aren't born capitalist, they adopt it, and that goes for the opposite as well; if you don't expose people to capitalist values or expose them to opposite values (i.e., cooperation, altruism) they won't naturally revert back to capitalism anyway. The fact that such a change in consciousness has not yet occurred on a mass scale is not proof that it won't and can't and that capitalism is therefore the pinnacle of human economics.

On greed in particular: greed is propagated when necessity or convenience demands it; in the case of past societies, necessity. In the case of modern society, capitalism, convenience. In the case of socialism, where neither necessity or convenience demands greed, what in the world makes you think humans, especially after generations of internalizing socialist values, would naturally regress to it?

t3_667hb4	"CMV: When it becomes widely available, a diet consisting primarily of 'lab-grown meat', would be more ethical than vegetarian or vegan diets."	"A little bit of background: I consume meat on a fairly regular basis, however. my girlfriend is a committed vegetarian and has been since she was very young. Recently, we both read an article on recent advances in the commercialization of lab-grown meat (more on this later) and its potential benefits. At the time, I asked her whether she would consider adding lab-grown meat to her diet if it becomes commercially viable and widely available, to which she replied with something along the lines of “probably not”. 

While that was basically the end of the discussion, it got me thinking about people who are vegetarian or vegan primarily due to their opposition to the killing of animals, or as a result of environmental concerns (such as clearing of rainforests/wilderness for cattle ranching, greenhouse gas emissions, etc.), and the effect that lab-grown meat would have upon them. With this in mind, I'd like to put forward the following view:

1) Not explicitly killing an animal to consume its flesh does not mean that no animals were harmed in the harvesting and production of non-meat products. It is clear that there will be some inadvertent deaths that result from any kind of farming; in the case of non-meat farming, for example, animals may be caught up in combine harvesters or other machinery, or else their habitats may be destroyed when the farmland is cleared during the harvesting process, or even when the land is to make room for the farmland in the first place. In light of this, it would seem that the realistic aims of vegetarians/vegans are to **minimize** animal suffering and environmental impact.

1) There is currently an effort to develop meat that is grown in the laboratory through the culturing of animal cells (see [this article](http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Memphis-Meats-introduces-lab-cultured-chicken-and-11003907.php) and [this article](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23576143), for illustrative examples). It is believed that these products could be commercially available as early as 2020. 

3) As far as I can tell, at no point is an animal killed in order to produce this lab grown meat. It would also seem that the inadvertent killing of animals would be minimized through the consumption of lab-grown meat.

Taking these points into account, it seems to me that if you are vegetarian/vegan, and the reasoning behind your diet is to minimise animal suffering and/or environmental impact, **and** if lab-grown meat (as exemplified in the articles above) becomes widely available and affordable, then it is both logical and ethically correct to switch to a diet consisting primarily of lab-grown meat. 

I look forward to having my opinion picked apart :)

t3_am3xxa	CMV: Current taxes on jet fuel are too low	"

Two of the assumptions this CMV post makes are:

- Aviation causes a large chunk of human-cause global warming
- The global economy takes a systematically lenient view of jet fuel, with exemptions allowed by way of various international agreements

I claim that flying, relative to other modes of transport which are blamed for climate change, is much too cheap. Concerns that carbon taxes disproportionately effect the poor (which seem valid) appear to demand a switch in focus to curtailing air travel, which is less necessary for essential economic activity. The relatively large element of frivolous consumption in international travel makes flying a justifiable target in my view. Jet fuel tax is fundamentally of the progressive taxation inventory. 

The tax is potentially a more politically viable proposal than increased levies on domestic fuel. For the globalist/left wing types a development in addressing climate change; for the nationalist/right wing types it should be seen as an opportunity to strengthen national self-sufficiency, discouraging whim-based emigration of younger, skilled workers, as well as an extra obstacle against mass immigration.

I am aware of the potentially huge global economic costs of making international travel and trade more expensive. The prototypical argument for this tax involves a directing of this revenue towards global development programmes as proposed on the basis of cost-benefit analyses conducted by think tanks such as the Copenhagen Consensus Centre (which identifies low-cost, high return  investments such as in mass production of basic child nutritional supplements, anti-malaria provisions, etc).

This is intended to start a conversation with a focus more theoretical than empirical. Although the introduction of pertinent facts is welcome, I want to know if my thinking is wrong conceptually as opposed to its failure to pass some esoteric economic analysis."	1	
t3_7aph16	"CMV: Societal change happens organically and incrementally through the actions of individuals and groups, and contrived attempts to force massive change are generally a bad idea"	"Societies, by which I mean the populations of nation-states, are constantly changing and evolving. This happens for a number of reasons including new technologies, intellectual and cultural movements (e.g. the Enlightenment, religions etc), and the actions of influential individuals and groups including politicians, academics and media figures. 

This is neither inherently good nor inherently bad, and has led to everything from gay rights to Jim Crow. As societies evolve, their laws generally follow suit, formalising changes that have already taken root on a social level. 

The view I'm looking to change is that attempts to skip or contravene this natural process via large-scale government, revolutionary or otherwise forceful means, is virtually always destructive and a poor idea. 

Principally, society is so vast, complex and unpredictable that any drastic artificial attempts to change its course will inevitably run into a whole host of severe unintended consequences. 

Here are a few examples:

- Soviet and Chinese communism: the massive, top-down economic and cultural initiatives by the governments of the USSR, PRC and other ""communist"" states in the 20th century led to millions of deaths, and a huge amount of inefficiency and waste

- US attempts to institute Western-style democracy in Iraq and Afghanistan have continually fallen short because the political system is largely alien to the locals. 

- Attempts during decolonisation to form European-style nation states in sub-Saharan Africa, where tribal and other sub-national traditions simply didn't lend themselves to that style of organisation, have left the continent in the grip of perpetual civil wars, secessions, and governments who use office as an opportunity to benefit their own ethnic group or settle scores against others. 


All these examples seem to demonstrate that forcing political and cultural changes on a society lead to chaos, disruption and failure. This is why I'm extremely sceptical of political ideologies like many on the far right or far left which seek to fundamentally reshape society in a short time-frame by governmental or paramilitary force. Compared to achieving their goals by social influence or gradual democratic means, such drastic and contrived methods seem extremely likely to just ruin societies and hurt people while probably not even succeeding in achieving their objectives.

**What I don't believe**

- I don't think moderate or incremental top-down efforts to alter society are necessarily doomed to failure. The UK government's seatbelt and anti-smoking campaigns have had demonstrable successes over the years, and the US federal government's role in the Civil Rights movement appears to have helped accelerate its progress. 

- I don't believe all drastic policy changes are necessarily doomed to failure. Where organic societal momentum is pushing in a drastic direction, government or paramilitary action in line with that can work out just fine. Examples of this are things like the American Revolution, where the break from Britain was drastic but also had clear roots in the organically-developed culture and outlook of many in the US at the time.


So, are there good examples of massive forced changes actually working out great? Am I somehow principally wrong to oppose them? If so, change my view!

t3_3uuytt	"CMV: ""Wasting"" water isn't wasting anything. (IE - leaving the sink on while you brush your teeth, full-flush toilets) because the water just reenters the water cycle and never goes anywhere."	"I live in michigan, so no water is running off into oceans or anything. If I were to leave my hose on outside all day, no water would really be wasted because it would eventually flow into the aquifer and be pumped up again by us. I'm willing to feel more conservative about this, but it doesn't make any sense to me why ""wasting"" water would be a thing, besides the small amount of energy spend in pumps and a tiny bit of money in filtration systems. It's not like we are running out of water, and California's problem is mostly due to environmental reasons (no rain) than anyone's personal use."	1	
t3_7ujn95	"CMV: The answer to lobbying and cronyism is less government, not more regulation."	"Lobbying is the result of government having its hands in the market; government influence over the economy means a business's best bet at success is gaining government favor in legislation. In turn, the taxpayer ends up subsidizing big business. 

The answer to reducing, if not altogether eliminating, this relationship (assuming it ought to be eliminated) is to neuter government influence in the market. More regulation as a solution for this problem is impossible for a few reasons:

1. Lobbying is not solely available to big business; anyone can lobby the government. It is indeed a constitutional right for a citizen to be able to lobby the government to affect policy.  Simply making lobbying illegal would stand in direct opposition to a constitutional right, thus we can't limit lobbying without seriously altering the fundamental relationship between the government and the people. 

2. The only government action that could curb lobbying by big business would be to criminalize it. As expressed in the previous point, this is untenable. Really, and perhaps ironically, the government's ability to prevent itself from becoming corrupted is hampered by the very language at its foundation.

3. The issue of campaign finance reform is relevant to this topic; by changing the way/amount individuals and organizations can contribute to political campaigns, lobbying could be curbed. However, this issue is highly contested by the people (politicians) who stand to gain the most from the current laws. It seems unlikely that the people benefiting from this exchange would intentionally cut off their own supply of money. I believe the saying ""Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely"" is in full effect here. Perhaps some truly benevolent people will come along one day, but I believe this quote is universal and that those in power don't stay good for long.

I believe the solution with the greatest potential is the limiting of regulation. By reducing (removing) regulation on the market, businesses, big and small, would have no incentive to lobby the government as the government would have no legal ability to fulfill the wants of each lobbyist via legislation. This means a businesses success or failure would be determined by the market and without any power structure assisting them; a truly free market.

I recognize this solution only addresses the problem of lobbying and cronyism and that such a severe level of deregulation has the potential to cause other problems. However, this highlights a relationship that may be unavoidable; *so long as there is regulation, there will be lobbyists and corruption.* If you can't agree to removing regulation, you better get used to living with in a world with lobbyists and money in politics.

t3_ieeddq	"CMV: The US should not have a policy of ""no first use"" of nuclear weapons."	"Most countries, including the US, have a policy of ""no first use"" of nuclear weapons, but the US is different - because it has the nuclear capability to do just that, it has the responsibility to use it - or not - if necessary.

The reason it is different is that we're a ""world power"", that we have the responsibility to use nuclear weapons to achieve our goals.

The problem is that most people, including myself, think that the US isn't a world power, that it has no responsibility to use nuclear weapons in the first place.

The US has been at war with terrorism since 9/11. The US currently has a large military presence in at least 25 countries, with the largest force in Iraq (which has been a war zone for decades, and is the largest recipient of US arms shipments, if not largest recipient - if not military presence) alone having almost 60,000 troops.

The US has almost 2.6 million active duty troops in Afghanistan/Iraq.

The reason for this is that the US was the only country to have a major bombing campaign or the first bombing campaign (and still is) in the 1970's and 1980's.

The US is involved in many conflicts, but I think that the US should still be the one who uses nuclear weapons.

I'm not a military/defense advocate, but the US has a long history of using nuclear weapons on its enemies, and I think that we should have a policy of ""no first use"", because it's the only way to keep the peace."	1

t3_6v30js	CMV: People in Westeros were right to ignore the White Walkers (spoiler alert)	"Spoilers for last episode below.





White walkers were being held back by the spells woven into the Wall.  There was no indication that those spells were being weakened, because the white walkers haven't attacked.  Jon Snow and the Night Watch should've at least wondered why this was and proceeded more cautiously.

Pretty easy to surmise that dragon fire may be able to blast down an ice wall.

So instead of hunkering behind the wall and doing more research about the threat, Jon Snow and the gang contrived to bring a freaking dragon and deliver it right to the hands of the White Walkers to turn it into a zombie dragon.

This is criminally negligent.  Everything would have been fine if everyone had just ignored the white walkers in the first place.  But due to hastiness and overreaction by Jon and Dany, the Wall is going to come down and a zombie army led by a zombie dragon is going to destroy everyone.  

Also, apt metaphor for ""white walkers = climate change"".  Libs overreact and destroy the economy for no gain, climate change still happens, but now we're too poor to build seawalls and relocate.

t3_fn1zv0	Cmv: there is no such thing as evil.	"See a lot of it on reddit lately.

""*so and so* are evil""

""*doing X* is evil"" 

I just dont get how the idea of evil could be anything other then a matter of perspective. Usually what they mean is ""selfish"" or ""malicious"" but those are not evil or necessarily bad.

I would prefer my girlfriend not kiss anyone but me, selfish? Yes. Evil? No

I like the idea of Oliver North rotting in prison, malicious? Yes, evil? I dont see why and I'm sure many of the people calling trumps admin evil would love for him to be persecuted for it. That's malice or at least vindictive.

Now the larger issue I see with this is when we label something as ""evil"" there is a disconnect from us.

""This person did X atrocities because they are evil"" instantly dismisses any of the actual reasoning they had for doing it, and discourages us from analyzing our own goals and means to achieve them. 

Hitler didnt do bad shit because he was ""evil"", hitler thought he was doing good shit. You have to constantly question whether or not what you are doing, and writing others of as evil gives us an excuse not to veiw our own actions and motivations in the same light."	1	
t3_3mld0q	CMV: Nuclear energy is a poor investment	"Nuclear Energy, while extremely efficient, is not a good type of energy to depend upon for two main reasons.

1. There is always the potential for catastrophic disaster. No matter how tightly regulated nuclear power is, you cannot completely eliminate the possibility of an explosion. You can greatly reduce the risk, but there will always be a risk, and the risk only becomes greater the more nuclear energy is produced. Even if you could completely eliminate human error, there are still random events- earthquakes, landslides, lightning- these can often be predicted but in the event that they aren't the results can be horrible.

2. It still produces waste- It's true that it is cleaner than coal and oil but nuclear power still produces extremely dangerous, extremely radioactive, and extremely explosive nuclear waste which, as of now, there is no good way to dispose of it. It is buried underground, dumped in the ocean, or stored in warehouses, and when uranium has a half life of 4.5 billion years or even plutonium at 24,000 years, the waste will accumulate and we won't be able to get rid of it.

TL;DR: it isn't 100% clean, nor is it the safest way to produce energy- while it is a good method there are much better options out there and we should stop pursuing it.

t3_6r1his	CMV: Skepticism of nuclear power is not antiscience	"I don't have strong opinions one way or another about nuclear power and that is not what I'm discussing here; rather, I take issue with several posts I've seen in this subreddit claiming that the fear of nuclear power is an example of liberal antiscience. 

My position is that both sides of the nuclear power debate are reasonable and have scientifically verifiable arguments. Arguments against nuclear power include: proliferation of nuclear weapons (see: Iran), issues with waste disposal, issues with the mining of uranium, environmental damage (for example, erosion and fish-kills caused by coolant systems, and potential tritium leaks), and Black Swan events (see: Fukushima, Chernobyl). Arguments in favor of nuclear power are generally based on the issues with every other form of energy generation, which nuclear power proponents generally argue are worse than the issues with nuclear power.

Again, I am not arguing against the use of nuclear power. Instead, I am taking the position that it's a complicated issue for which science does not provide a clear answer. I suppose I'm also implicitly making the accusation that those who disagree are conflating technological achievement with objective superiority.

t3_35vh4o	"CMV: There is only one possible future worth considering, one with the existence of AGI, and not enough people are planning around it"	"I believe that when considering the near or far future, there are only one possibility that is worth considering, and would be so transformative that worrying about anything else pales in comparison. That is the creation of Artificial General Intelligence or Artificial Strong Intelligence, whatever you want to call it.

First, you have to contend with the issue of whether or not you believe human or greater than level intelligence can even be created. Which I think most people would agree that it is possible, or at least there is nothing fundamental about intelligence that requires it to exist only in humans, or a biological substrate as opposed to some other.

Now, if you do accept that AGI is possible, you must then consider when you think it may be created and whether you or your direct descendants will be affected, if it happens 10,000 years from now, no one alive today would (or really should) care in the slightest. The issue is that unless you are directly involved in the field itself, coming up with a realistic timetable is a difficult problem. Fortunately for us laypeople (myself included), a survey was conducted at a conference of AI experts a few years ago, and concluded that the median optimistic year (10% likelihood) for AGI was 2022, the median realistic year (50% likelihood) was 2040, and the median pessimistic year (100% likelihood) was 2075. Now you are free to disagree with their predictions, but you'd better have damn good cause to do so and be takes seriously by other people. 

All of this taken together has forced me to the realization that there can be no useful forecasting of the near or long term future without considering the impact AGI could have on it. But further to this, no one can even make a solid guess as to what might happen if one is created! There is speculation, some good and some bad, but ultimately this event, the singularity, has an apt name for a reason, we have no prior history or examples from which to learn from! And then, to top it all off, an AGI would likely quickly surpass human intelligence if given the resources, not to mention it may think in such a way that humans could not even follow its logic or reasoning.

TL;DR: So all of this is to say, if you believe AGI is possible, and if you believe that it could come into existence in the nearish future, there is no way to make any easy generalizations about what the future might be like. We have no idea what's coming, and too many people are not factoring in the disruption an AGI could cause, whether for good or ill. Essentially, not enough people are taking this possibility seriously enough, and we're making plans about the future that are affecting people today without taking into account the most profound event in human history.

I have a few main points to bring up.

My first is that other animals eat strictly meat or omnivorous. They were evolutionarily evolved to eat both, and so were we. You wouldn't feed your dog or pet pig only greens, because they, omnivores, are specifically geared for a certain diet

Another point is vitamin/protein deficiency. I am not a big fan of beans so either I would need an alternate protein source or a reasonable argument that will make me learn to like beans.

And an argument against pescetarians, what makes a fish's life less valuable than a cow's or a pig's? Why are fish the ones that get picked on?

Also, if I go vegan/vegetarian/pescatarian it won’t make an impact on consumers and the amount of meat shipped to stores. I alone can’t do anything and not enough people will want to become vegan to make that big of a difference in our world

And If I buy cage-free, free-range eggs (as I usually do) is it sill not morally OK? This isn't as much of a point as it is a question.

However, the problem is not the changing environment. The problem is lack of ability to adapt. A lot of this may be attributed to a world where parents had it easier and don’t prepare the kids for todays higher requirements. Regardless today is different, and tomorrow even more so. 

The world, and thus it’s economies, and thus it’s companies, grow through the use of more complex systems. GDP grows via efficiency, or the ability to produce more with less. As cars, computers, food, clothing, manufacturing facilities, and the rest of the world’s industries get better, faster, more efficient, so do the demands of the workplace. We live in a society where younger generations have greater requirements to add value, yet struggle to do so. Older generations have had more time to grow slowly with changes, but younger generations have more ground to cover in less time. Every single year, the world becomes more complex, and those born today have even more to learn to become relevant than those born yesterday. You need to move faster. 

You can point fingers at older generations, complain about how much harder you have it, and post rants on the internet, but it isn’t going to change. Today is more challenging than yesterday, and tomorrow is more challenging than today. However, what you have are resources, infinitely free resources.

I want to comment on a personal level that I’m 23 and am off to a good start. I understand that things are not as simple as “work harder”, but you’re going to have to do your best. I bought a cheap laptop and watched free YouTube videos, and after 6-months of doing it as a recreational activity, I’d developed a complex smartphone application. It didn’t make any money. However, I was able to show it to the workforce. I was able to demonstrate my knowledge and be more valuable to my company, and thus the economy, and thus the world. You may have guessed, I am right wing, but it’s not because I love Trump. He is an asshole, but subsidizing everything is not the answer. If me make college cheaper today, the average intelligence level goes up, the economy grows, and then we are back to where we started, with higher educational requirements to stay relevant, and thus costs. If we raise the minimum wage, we simply reduce the incentive to increase our value, delaying the inevitable and furthering the issue.

As you can see, I am a skeptic on this subject, and therefore I am writing this CMV because I would like to read other people position on this matter. Are we good for our planet? Can Earth benefit from humanity? Can we still save it or it is too late?

t3_26kesy	CMV: GMOs are not harmful and have the potential to be extraordinary beneficial to our society.	"The county I live in (Jackson County) has a tremendous anti-gmo attitude, and even recently banned their cultivation. But no one has managed to convince me just how gmos are so terrible. I mean scientific review of 1783 papers in 2013 found that there are no plausible dangers to human health. The environmental effects of gmos are dependent on what crop is being used. Roundup ready crops certainly aren't the best, but BT crops are environmentally sound. It seems as if we could use gm crops in sustainable farming methods to achieve environmental benefits along with increased crop yields, disease and drought resistance, etc... Most of the hate for gmos seems to come from anti-monsanto ideas. Not saying Monsanto is perfect, but they don't do a lot of the things people say they do, such as sue farmers for accidental cross pollination.

t3_5r8usy	"CMV: We will never reach a future of common equal rights, good living standards and peace"	"This is something that has been bugging me for a while. 

One of the things that brings meaning to my life is working towards improving this world - Because all of my effort can bring a better future for us all. Kind of like a butterfly effect. One small positive thing can go far.

Yet, it's so much easier for us to shift towards greed, lust for power, feeling superior over others, while positive attributes requiere constant effort and work. Justifying unethical actions because the end justifies the means. While I agree that might sometimes be the case,  people often use that to push their own agendas. I mean, even when you think you're doing good, that might not be the case.

Which is when my conclusion that scares me comes in: Even in hundreds, thousands of years, Im concerned that we will not reach golden age of humanity. Especially concerning climate change and overpopulation. I know progress in technology can change all of that; but even facts are being questioned, and people manipulated.

t3_bkdtj1	"CMV: Cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are morally indefensible because of their impact on the environment"	"This CMV is about cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum that rely on “proof of work” for them to exist. I’m sure there are smaller cryptocurrencies that are designed to have no or minimal impact on the environment, but I’m not interested in those. I wanna concentrate on the biggest/well-known cryptocurrencies that do rely on mining, or whatever it is called.

I believe the so-called advantages cryptocurrencies are supposed to bring isn’t worth their cost to the environment. In 2017, apparently the whole Ethereum network (which is something like the third or fourth biggest cryptocoin) was using at minimum 2 Twh per year, which is roughly comparable to a small country. And that is just one cryptocurrency, there are others beside, each burning up (mostly) fossil fuels and giving little real back in return. And yeah it is mostly fossil fuels, why else would there have been all those mining centers opening up in China, if not for the cheap, but dirty, coal powered energy?

And what they give in return is dubious at best, even their fans generally can’t agree on the strengths. Is it safer than using a bank? Almost every month there’s another exchange going under, or getting hacked, or founder arrested. Is there any real anonymity using these, since it is all tracked on a public ledger? Are transactions faster, easier or cheaper than a bank transfer or direct debit? I never bought nor sold a cryptocoin, or have had anything to do with them, but the answer from what I can tell is a resounding “no”.

What would change my mind? I could think of some, are all the estimations I see online on how much power they require grossly mistaken? Can you make a case for it, for it to be worth and making up for the cost to environment, something I might have over looked?

If your attempt to convince me is to tell me that anthropomorphic climate change ain’t real, completely exaggerated, or that we don’t have a moral duty to ensure a decent enough planet for future generations, don’t bother trying to get deltas from me."	1

t3_5fzufx	CMV: There is No Point Lowering My Personal Carbon Footprint	"For the past decade or so I have taken many actions to lower my personal carbon footprint. The main reasons I have given myself:

1. Every little bit counts.
2. I'm setting a good example for others.
3. I'm signaling to government my willingness to accept carbon pricing and to the market my willingness to buy lower-carbon products.
4. I'm pre-adapting me to significantly priced carbon.
5. It gives me something to feel smug about.

Arguments against those reasons:

1. My footprint is insignificant on a global scale.
2. Other people don't pay attention to the choices I'm making unless I am obnoxious about them, which causes them to tune out.
3. My signals are drowned out by the loud cries for cheap gas and consumer goods from everyone else.
4. Significant carbon pricing isn't going to happen anytime soon and if it ever does it will be gradually phased in.
5. See #2. It's hard to feel smug when no one cares.

With the election of Trump in the US, the approval of the Kinder Morgan Trans Mountain pipeline in Canada, and the rise of right-wing nationalism in Europe, it seems clear that reducing carbon emissions is not a priority for the vast majority of people and they will not support gradual reduction to sustainable levels. Carbon emissions will only be reduced voluntarily in response to catastrophic events caused unmistakably by climate change or non-voluntarily by the disruption of industry by such events. Either way, there is no point in making personal sacrifices while waiting for those events to occur and increasing my personal carbon footprint may actually accelerate those events by a minuscule amount.

Please change my view before I buy a Hummer.

t3_52s438	CMV:The USA Should Have a Carbon Tax	"Currently the USA is one of the largest consumers of fossil fuels and as a consequence on of the largest emitters of greenhouse gasses. Climate Change is a pressing issue and a tax on emissions, especially in manufacturing, transportation, and power generation, would assist in fixing the problem by providing incentives for lowering fuel consumption. Furthermore it would push the development of clean energy sources, which would create jobs and benefit the economy, and reduce reliance on foreign oil. I think that current incentives to reduce emissions are lacking horribly and that a carbon tax now will save the USA money and hardship in the future.

t3_2rcrkd	CMV: Veganism and vegetarianism are not the best way to improve farm animal welfare	"Title is mostly to get attention, and I'm working from a specific set of assumptions. My argument is as follows:

1) The chances of the entire world adopting a vegan/vegetarian diet are slim to none

1a) Therefore, there will always be a market for meat and other animal products

2) The food market, like all other markets, operates on general principles of supply and demand

3) Meat farmers can use techniques exhibiting a range of costs or benefits, both in terms of environmental impact and animal welfare.

4) A vegan or vegetarian diet denies demand, and thus potential revenue, to all meat-producing farms, regardless of how humane or environmentally sound their practice are.

4a) Since the majority of farms are large factory farms, I concede that this is probably good for animal welfare. **However**:

5) Purchasing meat from farms known to produce their meat in an ethical way not only denies demand to large factory farms but helps improve the market share of ethical meat-growing, which seems as though it would be even better for animal welfare.

My general view is that people should probably as a rule eat less meat from better growers, and that will make for a bigger shift in growing practices than simply people dropping out of eating meat altogether. Moreover, this practice would be much easier to ""evangelize"" than a vegetarian or vegan diet. Face it, meat is tasty (and non-factory meat is often tastier than factory-farmed meat, at least in my own anecdotal experience)

t3_dqltww	CMV: A plastic tax is the only reasonable way to reduce production and limit microplastics in the environment	"Plastic is in almost everything. It has become our favorite material. This is because it is cheap and versatile. 

Science provides a clear and growing body of research supporting the damaging effects of plastics in the environment.

The current rules of the market allow plastics environmental costs to be externalized: that is, the planet pays the price for our convenient use of plastics in short-lived products. 

There will always be a demand for plastic products as long as they remain the cheapest alternative, and it is not reasonable to expect consumers to move away from plastics voluntarily. There will be little incentive to move away from plastics unless the cost to the environment can be imposed. A tax on plastics that increases gradually over time is the most reasonable way to accomplish this."	1

t3_8m26kg	CMV: Celsius is no better of a measure of temperature than Fahrenheit for practical purposes.	"Celsius doesn't have the advantages of being part of a standard and useful metric system in increments and divisions of ten like its volume or length measuring counterparts (kilograms, meters, amperes). It is not more practically useful to use it over the Fahrenheit system as it doesn't come with and more useful benefits. It's only real meaningful setup is for measuring water temperature: 0-100 Celsius is freezing to boiling water (though even then, not quite, its like 99.98c for boiling.) While this is a better standard for water temperature purposes, this isn't useful for people day to day. 

Fahrenheit, on the other hand, measures a pretty close amalgamation of the general spectrum of the human experience in regards to temperature: for the most part, humans live and see changes in the season on a 0-100 scale, 100 being hot and 0 being cold, with some places being sometimes hotter or colder but not by much more than 10-20%. Therefore, it is practically more useful and should be the standard for human understanding of weather. 

Just compare the standard range of human temperature, -20 to 110 degrees which is 130 degree range. In Celsius, this range is  -28.8 degrees to 43.3 degrees, a 72.1 degree range, which is just about half as precise even if we all got used to an arbitrary range of numbers to encompass the human experience of air temperature.

Assuming that it's possible to get all of humanity to change its ways in time to hold off the devastating, apocalyptic effects of climate change for another 10,000 years or longer, then figuring out a way to rally the world should be the top priority.

t3_278kdr	"CMV:""Voluntary"" methods of dealing with overpopulation will be ineffective at limiting population growth long-term"	"Methods of controlling the population with voluntary methods will never work, at least in the long term.  Even though in the short term, some people use contraceptives and refuse to reproduce, we are essentially breeding people to want to procreate. The reason why population growth is declining now is because, in our evolutionary history, we have never been exposed to the things that limit the population to the extent that we do today, and therefore have not evolved resistance to them.

There are only two viable solutions to overpopulation that I am aware of: sustainable agriculture and population control by force. If strict sustainable agriculture, humans will ultimately live at a subsistence level, but will not have to worry about massive famines due to fluctuations in the food supply caused by unsustainable agriculture. The other method, brute force, would most likely involve some combination of forced abortions, forced sterilizations, and/or infanticide.

For decades I have watched both the Democrat and Republican parties take part in the same kinds of corruption, vote for much of the same detrimental policies and be just as guilty of oppression and violence.

I see that each party has its own narrative as far as what they tell their base. The politicians will say opposing things, but make the same actions. For instance, while Bush instituted the Patriot Act and sent out drone strikes and gave billions in corporate welfare, Obama has done the same, and in many cases, even more so. 

Every President says things that make their base all warm and fuzzy. Bush talked about family and Jesus and Obama talks about medical reform and gay rights. Yet their actions are extremely alike. At this point, when it comes to war, corruption, and giving power to corporations over people, it doesn't matter who is in office anymore.

"[Animal agriculture, the second largest source of greenhouse gases, accounts for ~15% of emissions (roughly equivalent to the entire transportation sector).](https://climatenexus.org/climate-issues/food/animal-agricultures-impact-on-climate-change/) This doesn't take into account the transportation of grains to factory farms, the transportation of livestock to slaughterhouses, and then the transportation of their bodies to grocery stores (more steps and thus more pollution than transporting grains to grocery stores).

[Animal agriculture is responsible for ~80% of deforestation globally.](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/09/120925091608.htm) Being that trees are a natural carbon sink it is practically suicide to cut them down for grazing land.

[1/3 of agricultural land is used to grow livestock feed.](https://www.onegreenplanet.org/environment/livestock-feed-and-habitat-destruction/) Considering that millions of humans are starving I consider it criminal to breed animals into existence and feed them these grains so that rich first world counties can eat these animals.

[Run of from factory farms is contribution  to the destruction of the oceans.](https://mission-blue.org/2015/02/whats-the-role-of-mass-animal-agriculture-in-ocean-degradation/) Compound this with overfishing ([salt-water fish will be extinct by the middle of the century on the path we're on](https://www.google.com/amp/s/relay.nationalgeographic.com/proxy/distribution/public/amp/animals/2006/11/seafood-biodiversity)) and we are facing a serious crisis in the oceans on large part because of our eating habits.

Considering that humans [can thrive on a plant based diet at all life stages](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/19562864/) I think the evidence is clear: If you want to grow old on a life sustaining planet you need to go vegan and try to convince everyone around you to go vegan immediately.

t3_5m7oec	CMV: Believing in the Christian god doesn't make sense	"I grew up in a family without religion (although my parents supported us exploring any religion we liked) and I don't believe in any god(s). Furthermore, I don't think it makes sense to believe at least in the god set forward by Christianity (and most monotheistic religions, but I'll stick to Christianity because I don't have a solid enough grasp on the others to really debate them--and for brevity's sake, I'll just use 'God' from now on). I want my view changed because I know a lot of intelligent, rational people are Christian, and I want to understand how they can believe in something that seems to make no sense.

Basically, my understanding of God is that he's an all-knowing, all-powerful, supremely good being. (My philosophy of religion professor called this a Three-O God: omniscient, omnipotent, omni-benevolent.) My issue then is with the presence of evil in the world. This is not a new question--it was a large (but to me, unsatisfying) segment of the previously-mentioned philosophy class--but I've never gotten an answer I'm happy with. Basically, if God is omniscient, omnipotent, and omni-benevolent, how can evil exist? He should know about evil, be able to stop evil, and want to stop evil. He can be any two of the three, but not all three.

The most common answer I've heard is that free will allows for evil, but also allows for a greater good than could exist without free will. This seems pretty implausible to me; if God is all-powerful, why can't he create those goods? Even if he can't because it's somehow an oxymoron (the ""God can't create a burrito so big he can't eat it"" argument), why wouldn't God create humans to be predisposed to do good rather than evil? Instead, we have all these instincts--tribalism, selfishness, greed--that we have to fight if we want to act morally.

But even setting that aside, what about evil that exists independent of human action? Even if we can put genocide down to free will, what about tsunamis? How is a tsunami part of God's loving plan? People say that bad things happen so greater good things can come, but for some people, they don't. If you die in an earthquake, there's no good coming after that (heaven, but you'll get there eventually anyway, so why the earthquake?)

Basically, if God showed up in my bedroom today, I'd have a massive bone to pick with him about all the suffering in the world. Why do reasonable people think he's real, not to mention comforting?

There are so many risks that come with burning trash. Some of the risks include headaches and nausea. Other more serious risks include cancer and asthma. It only takes up to 40 burning barrels to put off the same level of toxins emitted from a 200 ton per day incinerator that serves 20,000 households. Those incinerators have precautions in place to help get rid of the toxins. Our backyard burning barrels do not. 
I know many people say we have been burning trash for 50 years. Yes and they are correct. However, trash has changed over the last 50 years. The dioxins put off today are so much worse for you than they were 50 years ago. Dioxins are a group of 30 highly toxic chlorinated organic chemicals. These dioxins have been proven to cause cancer and reproductive and development problems.  50 years ago the trash being burnt was mostly untreated paper, wood and glass. Today we are burning paper that is treated with chlorine. When burnt dioxins are sent into the air. We are burning plastics, packing material, and so much more. 
I grew up burning trash as everyone else did. My son has asthma. We can not afford for him to breathe my neighbors burning trash. I know it may seem easy, just go inside. Its  not that easy. You see those dioxins that are released into the air don't stop there. They go onto our plants, into our water systems, eventually into us by the foods we eat.

t3_hnpsv8	"cmv: The obvious important problem in modern american politics, which nobody is talking about nor earnestly trying to solve, is the breadth of ignorance within the electorate..."	"... and the reason nobody is talking about this obvious problem is because it isn't currently profitable to do so.

(While this post is specifically regarding modern american politics, it is certainly not *unique* to that context.)

Many political opinions concern details in running the most complex machines of human history: countries. These opinions are held regardless of comprehension of underlying prerequisites like ethics, economics, statistics, etc... instead manifesting as the one-of-two ideas which survive the pipeline of being formally endorsed by a party. Everyone knows this.

The problem is that political capital is ""proportion of the electorate \* power of that proportion \* energy of that proportion"". This means to make moves, you either need to appeal to more people, appeal to powerful people, and/or rile people up. Billions of dollars are pumped into massaging the opinions of those proportions, even (especially?) those wholly unqualified to meaningfully have one. Everyone knows this.

This is like rocket scientists determining which fuel to use for their next launch by betting on a cock fight. The result would be millions of dollars invested by lobbyists to train fighting chickens.

Historical efforts to solve this by restricting power to a limited ""educated"" group has led to a politics which is *instead* moved to enact policy which *precisely retains* that restriction. That problem, however, is still thoroughly present in our current system- it just takes the form of power investing in power-preserving fighting chickens!

For a member of any party to acknowledge publicly that the hoops they are jumping through are targeted primarily to move ignoramuses (rather than ""to do what is best"") is to immediately lose a mass of fighting chickens (chickens prefer to fight if they are considered important, I guess?). So the public discourse bubbles on -with the continued backing of billions- about the latest cockfight.

So, the madness has an explanation. That does not mean it isn't *1. mad, and 2. obviously so, and 3. especially to those training chickens.*

It neither means ""both sides are equally nonsense"". One rocket scientist can be backing [LOX and RP-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rocket_propellant#Liquid_chemical_rocket_propellants), and the other scientist kool aid (disclaimer: I know nothing about rocket science). The issue is that both are forced to argue via chicken without admitting that's ridiculous.

An additional problem: if you realize you're a chicken, and so disengage from cockfights, you've simultaneously identified yourself as slightly more self aware than average, and also *removed one chicken from the army backed by the more-self-aware-than-average electorate.*

I don't know a solution to this problem, but its absence from constant public admission to what is obviously happening should change.

t3_aidx1d	"CMV: If we do not have a revolution within the next 20 years, Humanity will cease to exist."	"Okay so basically my line of thinking is this, it's plastered all over the news that global warming will be past the stage of prevention in 20 years, not just past the stage of reversal, but past the stage in which there is anything we can do. This is coming from essentially everybody in the scientific community, who say that this can only be prevented by reducing our carbon output by 50%

Here's the thing though, 70% of all carbon emissions are created by just 100 or so companies, so even if we all live carbon neutrally, we're still in the red, deep in the fucking red. These companies are not going to change their ways unless they are regulated, which won't happen because the people in office are sponsored by these companies, so realistically full scale revolution is absolutely necessary.

t3_p5hf32	CMV: New nuclear reactors are not going to form a significant portion of US energy decarbonization between now and the mid-late 2030s.	"Because this is a topic with a lot of really fervent advocates whose attention I'm likely to draw, let me clarify some things about what I'm not saying:

1. I am espousing a PREDICTIVE view, not a normative view. I am not arguing whether nuclear power is good or bad, necessary or unnecessary.

2. I am not talking about existing reactors that face retirement. That's an interesting topic but outside this scope.

3. I'm not talking about the politics or economics of nuclear power in other countries. Again, interesting but not relevant.

The critical timeframe for US grid decarbonization is the next 10-15 years. That's roughly the timeframe the Biden administration is talking about to hit emissions targets of ~50% below 2005 levels. To be a part of a decarbonization strategy that fits within this timeframe, nuclear power will have to overcome a number of key economic and political obstacles:

It's slow. Any low-carbon energy generation is only as useful as the fossil-fuel generation it enables us to take off the grid. For any source, this means that it's only useful once it's finished and begins pumping megawatts onto the grid. In the case of nuclear, if we're to judge by previous examples--especially in the US--that's a very long time. The newest reactor in the US that I'm aware of, Watts Bar 2, took more than 30 years between construction beginning and the reactor actually going online. Even a global median has [tended to be in the 5-10 year construction range](https://inis.iaea.org/collection/NCLCollectionStore/_Public/42/105/42105221.pdf). Part of this is because:

The US has a very NIMBY-friendly planning and construction process. We don't have to like it, but we have to acknowledge it. We've made it very easy for people to halt construction on a whole host of processes due to a whole range of concerns. For nuclear power to move forward with new construction, the industry will have to figure out a way to either convince NIMBYs or directly oppose and overcome them. This is not an obstacle unique to nuclear power (as NIMBYs have successfully opposed wind and solar projects) but it is still one that the nuclear power industry cannot pretend is nonexistent. 

Additionally, it's a very difficult technology to work with, and a great deal of its current workforce is [nearing retirement age](https://www.power-eng.com/nuclear/who-will-replace-nuclear-power-s-aging-work-force/#gref) without a real path forward to replacement, or even expansion, of that workforce.

Lastly, nuclear is expensive. Last year's Lazard LCOE analysis suggests that nuclear has a levelized cost of energy range of 118-192 $ /MWh for nuclear power, while wind is $28-54 and utility-scale solar is $32-44. There's just not a good reason for financiers to fund new nuclear plants. If people want to argue that federal subsidies or investment could flip this picture, I'd ask that they make the case for those subsidies/investments to actually come into being. As a point of comparison, the federal government *could* fund a national-scale high speed rail network too, but the fact is that it isn't and likely won't in the immediate future.

To pre-empt the people who will bring up SMRs, I'm aware of these and that there are some pilot projects in the planning stages. However, I do not expect these to be deployed at any kind of scale meaningful to the process of national energy-sector decarbonization within the timeframe of interest here, especially bearing in mind the industry's history of both cost and time overruns. The existence of a few pilot SMR deployments would not change my view."	1

t3_2wh8j4	CMV: The US Government should re-evaluate and re-distribute subsidies given to Fossil-fuel companies.	"I believe that the United States is to heavily dependent on fossil fuel technologies (Coal, Oil, and Gas) It is a heavy burden to our economy and environment to subsidize fossil-fuel companies. By removing the subsidies given to fossil-fuel companies and re-distributing that money, we would create more revenue for the economy and create more incentives and jobs to focus on renewable energy and alternative sources.

Current subsidies range up to $52 billion in just the production and finding fossil fuels. According to the National Research Council when evaluating air pollution and health impacts, It adds a staggering estimate of $120 billion that's collected from subsidies,loans, and grants.

Removing these subsidies will balance the power that Major Oil and Coal mining companies have. There are tons of benefits to doing this which include

*Cleaner Energy
*More Incentives to research cleaner energy
*More Money for the government
*Less chances of exploitation by companies seeking these subsidies and cuts.

We need to phase out of fossil fuel production and consumption, and in order to do that, we need to stop subsidizing the production of fossil fuels.

t3_3bdnmw	CMV: I have a few ethical ideas for avoiding/reducing consumption of factory farmed meat products	"I've been avoiding meat products and rarely eating fish for a little less than half a year. I have decided that I don't have a problem with eating meat, but I do have a problem with the way meat industries keep the animals in captivity. My current argument is that because we as a human race are powerful enough to have taken complete control over entire species' (cattle, chicken), at the very least, we should be respectful enough to provide at least a decent life and a painless death to those animals. With this mindset, I would have no problem with eating meat if it were to be wasted otherwise, if it were from a truly free-range farm, or if it had been wild and hunted.

I feel this is a good reason for humans to avoid/reduce consumption of/look for alternatives to factory farmed meat. I am more concerned with hearing what ethical counter-arguments others may have to these points than having someone change my view--although I am not opposed to changing it.

There is no feasible replacement for copper right now.

If everyone has the same standard of living, no matter how low it is, we're going to run out of these even quicker. If we want to continue the way we're living now, the only solution is to somehow eliminate most of humanity, and the most probable way of this happening is a world war over these resources.

Otherwise, we're all gonna have to get used to living like the Amish, since computers and electricity are going to just become more rare and without solar energy we're not going to have a replacement for fossil fuel.

t3_1fyj6e	"I believe that might makes right, and so-called ""ethics"" only matter if you can enforce them. Please CMV."	"""The strong do what they can, the weak suffer what they must."" -Thucydides, c.400 BC

I strongly desire to see a more just, caring, fair, and benevolent world. And yet the more I examine the way the world works, the more it's obvious that this is almost logically impossible.

If might doesn't make right - i.e., if there's some sort of ""rightness"" other than what happens, then whatever is meant by ""rightness"" has no functional bearing on the real world.

If you believe something ""should"" happen, then either you have the power to enforce what you think ""should"" happen, or what you think ""should"" happen doesn't actually matter.

(Obviously, soft power - such as the ability to elicit sympathy from others who can form a coalition with you to increase your ability to enforce change - counts just as much as hard power does).

This succinctly explains much of what we see in the world. Uncharismatic people are punished more than charismatic people, because they don't have the power to make other people enforce their so-called views of ""fairness"". Rich people get away with more than poor people, because their positions of power and privilege make it more difficult to punish them. Police can do things that private citizens would never dream of trying, because nemo custodit ipso custodes.

The answer to every social injustice in the world, at the bottom, seems to be ""oh yeah? well who's gonna stop me?""

t3_20nrcb	"""Nuclear power is bad"", CMV"	"**My view has been changed, I am also sorry for abandoning the threat, I completely forgot about it. The two users who contributed to changing my view the most were awarded deltas accordingly.**

I believe that we should not use nuclear power and instead focus on renewable resources.

With rising population and advancing technology, the power demand of humanity is increasing. And we must meet that demand and provide sufficient power to cover all our needs. There are various ways of doing so. Today, the most of our power is suppiled by fossil-fuel-burning power plants. However, they present serious threat to the enviroment, so we need to look for our power sources elsewhere. The other options are renewable resources, scuch as water, sunlight, and wind; or nuclear power. I do NOT believe that nuclear power is the right way of progress, and I believe so for these reasons:

1) The price. Nuclear power plants are incredibly expensive to build and maintain. The building costs a small fortune, since all the reactors, shielding, and other protective structures are exteptionally hard and costly to build. Then there is the nuclear fuel, the mos common being U235. It is quite hard to get. The mining alone is quite tedious , moreover, it damages the surroundings a lot, and it's expencive to restore to the previous state. What's more, some of the damages to nature, the common heritage of mankind, are irreparable whatsoever. The fuel is also hard to process and transport, both of which are not only expensive, but also present a serious threat to the enviroment, which is, as I have explained before, not exactly a thing we want. And the same goes to the costs and risks of nuclear waste transport, reprocessing or disposal. 
In conclusion, nuclear power is costly in both economical and enviromental aspects.

2) safety. I have to concede, that modern nuclear powerplants are quite safe and a major safety failure is just a rare occurence. However, the damage these potential failures can bring upon mankind and the enviroment is immense. In case of major breach of the reactor shielding huge anmounts of radiation and/or fallout escape the power plant. These horribly affect global enviroment and severely damage human health. although it is true that the failure is quite improbable, if it occurs, the aftermath will be disastrous.
Another safety hazard is the risk of the power plant being damaged in the instance of war or terrorist attack. Power plants are important military targets, so in the case of war are likely to be attacked. The possibility of a disaster following the destruction of a nuclaer power plant also makes it an extcellent target for terrosrists, who just want to cause maximal damage.
To sum this up, there is possibility of a safety failure, and despite its low pobability it is still not worth the possible outcome.

3) Alternative sources. As I mentioned at the very beginning, there are other means of getting power. The alterantive resources, such as water, air and sloar power are cheaper to harness and present barely any threat to our planet. I believe that instead of focusing on nuclear power, inovations should be ecnouraged in this area

I believe that nuclear power is simply too dangerous to utilize. We should therefore focus on alternative resources, as they are more enviroment friendly, safer, cheaper and do not present a major threat to mankind.

Wow, a bit longer than I expected. Mostly, the thing is that in my country, they are planning on expanding one of our power plants, and the Austirans think it's wrong, and I basicaly second this attitude. so, please, CMV

t3_42k43l	CMV: Imperialism is largely responsible for the fact that humanity has never been more well off than it is today	"Thanks to ""capitalism"" (starting with its early mercantilist form), our ability to exploit resources for our own (read:human) benefit has led to a utilitarian outcome. Interconnectedness in world-trade means that there is, proportionately, less war and conflict than ever before. On a side note, our planet would be worse-off if socialist or communist governments had been in charge post-WWII, as to produce the same good or service in the USSR more materials are required (productivity would also have risen at a slower rate - essentially would have kickstarted global warming without the technological development to potentially halt it).


Imperialism, where european powers were able to exploit the strategic advantages of an industrialised military to access cheap and abundant resources that were not economically available in Europe, is what fuelled the boom in productivity and innovation. Utilising steam-boats to circumvent the tough resistance from local populations in Africa and diseases is an example of this, not to mention the outcome of the Opium Wars. Selling the manufactured goods, mainly textiles, back to the local population at a lower price than the traditional manufacturers could compete with, led to a Unipolar world balance of power (Great Britain being the most powerful nation for the next century). Historically this has meant that there are fewer conflicts overall around the world, which in turn fosters more trade and interconnectedness, and here we are today.


From the Spectator:
""Take global poverty. In 1990, the UN announced Millennium Development Goals, the first of which was to halve the number of people in extreme poverty by 2015. It emerged this year that the target was met in 2008. Yet the achievement did not merit an official announcement, presumably because it was not achieved by any government scheme but by the pace of global capitalism. Buying cheap plastic toys made in China really is helping to make poverty history. And global inequality? This, too, is lower now than any point in modern times. Globalisation means the world’s not just getting richer, but fairer too.""


People once had a reasonable expectation of death from war, conflict, and violence. In surveys of nomadic and hunger gatherer remains, usually in the neighborhood of 30-50% show signs of death by violence. So for the first few hundred thousands of years of humans, violence was just life, not confined to action movies. Just imagine if half the people you ever knew were killed with an axe to the head or an arrow to the knee.


Nowadays, less than one quarter of 1% of people on Earth die from violence, and that has been falling steadily for decades. Most kids growing up now across the world will never know anyone who dies in war.


TL;DR Greed is good and global inequality has never been more equal than it is today thanks to imperialism."	1

Political scientists, philosophers and economists have proposed various alternative forms of governance and we see numerous alternatives around the world. I do not see the point of continuing to uphold a democracy just for the sake of it, when technocratic governments or oligarchies are able to produce a better life for our societies. 

Not having to vote would take away a huge burden from our societies: Not only from the individual citizen but also from the politicians. Today, they have to act as if they are accountable to the people and as if they do not bend to lobbyists and corporate interests. In a technocracy, the ruling class could improve social life, implement all the measures that improve working conditions, alleviate climate change etc.

t3_cuoh9o	CMV: plastic straw bans and plastic bag bans does more damage in regards to environmentalist movement than it benefits the movement	"So in certain locations in the US there's been recent laws passed to ban plastic consumer products that used to be free, straws and shipping bags. The straws I am mostly against because it is so small ball that imposing it evokes that the effort is meaningless, while plastic shopping bags tend leaves the plastic packaging of the groceries entirely untouched - - so the consumer has a reusable grocery bag full of plastic bags/packaging of bread, cereal, cookies, chips, eggs, cold cuts, frozen veggies, and basically everything else that doesn't have hard plastic or other material that could be recyclable.
 
Rather than giving busy work for the consumer, why not mandate the food packaging be in recyclable or biodegradable material, which isn't an impossibility, Taiwan in the last 30 years went from being buried in garbage to transitioning to a drastically low municipal solid waste being produced per capita. Taiwan did this not by imposing consumer level bans, but products having as little of disposal packaging as possible and the residents have become expectant to have only recyclable packaging since fees for garbage removal is nearly exorbitant compared to free recycling services with multiple collections every week day to haul away recyclables. The consumers are both choosing to purchase less disposable packaging and the businesses are less likely to use disposable packaging.
 
The bans on plastic straws and shopping bags shifts responsibility from the companies that produce the bulk of the disposable garbage onto the consumer who is just reacting to what's being made available. This also communicates to the public how environmental degradation is a non-issie; akin to demanding everyone to send out ""thoughts and prayers"" and only ""thoughts and prayers"" to tragedies rather than changes to public policy or effective assistance to natural disasters. Like an eco-warrior tried to convince me that my using a plastic straw means that I am not helping the environment, I would assume that individual is clueless dilettante who has no idea what would actually be effective legislation and simply doing something, anything, is better than nothing; which I could not disagree more with.

Planet Earth will be here millions of years after our species has either become extinct or left the earth for other places in space. We are not concerned about the planet, we are concerned about what this planet will do to us humans. Saying you care about the planet is really saying you care about people. For the Earth it doesn't matter if we are here or not. So therefore the Triple Bottom Line creates a false sense of social responsibility and the Planet should be removed from it.

Update:
Most of the commenters seem to agree that ""Planet"" is a metaphor for long term sustainability, social values etc. as where ""People"" is a metaphor for shorter term goals. Although I do think it's not a strong metaphor in this sense I do now see how ""Planet"" fits the alliteration.

Denying Ice core samples, denying moon landing/space missions because people weren't actually there.  This is an argument against knowing anything in the abstract because it ignores the information we can gather with our senses.

Someone might win a nobel prize if they ""turned"" from the ""inside"" and demonstrated how climate change science has been a lie for decades.  If any NASA scientist admitted they have been lying about their day job that would change everything. 

**Both would require millions of people lying over dozens of countries, thousands of institutions, over decades.**  Again, these whistle blowers would be one of the most important people in history.

The amount of people needed to keep this a secret is mind boggling. 

**Both are pretty obtuse when they talk about the particular scientific principles.  Pulling snippets here and there completely out of context.**

That nonsense about ""the climate was warming the in 70s"" which is false and this would not be the conclusion someone would draw if they looked at the metadata of the papers.  Flat Earthers would say the curvature of the earth is visible because our eyes/plane windows are round, or something. 

**Both claim that NASA is lying to us.**

This stands on its own.  Both collect a ton of data and both groups deny all of it.

And from the Lithium mining i've seen so far, it does a horrible amount of damage to the environment, similar to how Fossil Fuels pollute and damage the atmosphere. 

Hydrogen combustion also is very powerful, with an immense amount of energy, and as technology progresses, we are learning how to control it even further.

Hydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe, and exists diatomically, meaning that if we came across hydrogen, we can easily use combustion on it. Also, Lithium is nowhere near as abundant as Hydrogen, so if we were to go colonize the universe, it would make more sense to use hydrogen. Even further, hydrogen is in nearly everything (especially water which is abundant here), surely we can figure out cheaper methods to extract hydrogen from these compounds.

Similar to Electric power, Hydrogen cars emit no harmful emissions. We've even used hydrogen before in a plethora of inventions, such as Airships. Also, instead of waiting around for hours waiting for something to recharge, Hydrogen Fuel can go into a vehicle in around the same time it takes gasoline to fill up a vehicle.

After all, there is enough alternate dimension real estate to sustain entire populations of dragons, hippogriffs, giant spiders, etc. Wizards could easily chose to live their whole lives in the alternate dimensions.

2) It appears the main reason that wizards interact in the non-wizardly world is that it amuses them. Notice that the term ""muggle"" is used in a derogatory fashion throughout the books. Notice a complete lack of concern for muggle lives. I suppose they do have one class in school about muggle studies, attempting to learn all of society in one semester of studying. That's as close as they come.

3) Wizards routinely mindwipe muggles whenever they see fit, almost always for their own personal benefit. There is no doubt it is evil to wipe people's minds, but wizards do this on a regular basis with practically no guilty conscious or signs of an internal moral struggle.

4) Worse, with Hermoine we see that they enter the non-wizard world, take our best and brightest minds who could be real difference makers in our world, and take them for their own. Say what you will for Voldemort, but that was one step too evil even for him.

5) Wizards appear to have the power to make tremendous positive changes on the non-wizardly world, and no one seems to care. Think of how many children die of horrible diseases while wizards sit on their wands and do nothing.

6) The things that Rowling tries to show that make Potter and friends ""good"" is that they defeat Voldemort and they stay loyal to their friends. But even skinhead assholes fight for causes they believe in and are loyal to their friends. These two traits alone are not enough to register one as being truly good.

7) It appears the reason wizards don't openly interact with the non-wizard world is a fear of witch hunts. But isn't this a failure to do great acts of kindness and good out of cowardice - - the exact opposite of heroism? Plus, wizards don't face any real threat from the non-wizard world because they can always retreat to alternate dimensions where non-wizards can't touch them. So the reason they don't routinely save dying children at the hospital is less to do with fear for their own safety and more to do with not wanting to mess up their ability to use the non-wizard world as their own amusement parks.

8) By the end of the books, Potter must have been the most popular wizard in the history of wizardry. With the especially bright Hermione and the common-person charismatic appeal of Ron by his side, Potter could have taken the opportunity to radically change the wizard world for the better. If not attempt to show even the slightest bit of compassion for the lesser muggles, at least address some of the odd class structure and other injustices of his own wizardly world. No instead of making a positive change for the better, he backs away from it all and takes a rather mundane middle class anonymous job.

I mean, at the very, very least he could have demanded that Hogwarts quit placing a quarter of its students in House Evil. I mean, why on earth would you want to train a quarter of all wizards to be evil?

t3_72l7ze	"CMV: people who care about the environment should still have kids, and people who don't want kids should not use carbon footprints as their reason not to have kids"	"Every week  some redditor comments about how their personal decision to not have kids is going to remake the world into a better, more environmentally sustainable place. Now, everybody clearly has the right to have kids or not. But the advertised logic makes no sense.


If environmentalism was the main reason to not have kids, the people who don't give a shit about carbon footprints will have kids. While children are hardly direct clones of their parents, I believe that they often listen to and are affected by their parent's beliefs, even if their parents are redditors.


If you care about the environment, trying to help educate the next generation in being equally aware of its beauty and fragility makes far more sense to me than neutering oneself. In fact, it's hard to think of a more counterproductive political strategy than to purposefully eliminate a chance to raise aware, smart children who care about the environment. And if you simply don't want to have children, finding a better or more honest reason is the more mature thing to do too.


I think redditors who cite the environment as a reason to not have children are either using that as a socially easy excuse, or are naive about the long-term repercussions if all green friendly people did the same.

t3_2q12vx	"CMV: DPRK and Russian criticisms of human rights abuses in the US are legitimate, and deserve to be taken seriously."	"In light of the recently released CIA torture report, as well as mass protests and demonstrations about the current status of race relations in the US, many world leaders, including North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un and Russian leader Vladimir Putin, have voiced concern over the status of human rights in the United States. The criticisms by Putin and Kim have been laughed off by the media, considering the irony of those two leaders criticizing another country for its human rights record, when they each themselves have poor human rights records. North Korea especially has arguably the worst human rights record on the planet, with large scale evidence of barbaric death camps within the country's borders.

However, in spite of the poor rights record of each country, their concerns about human rights in the US are equally as valid as the US' concern for human rights in Russia and DPRK. The point stands that the CIA did, in fact, torture inmates at Guantanamo for information, and it's therefore just as ironic for the US to criticize other countries for the same behaviour, even if it's in larger scales or greater severity. If the US wishes to ever redeem itself, it needs to punish those involved, change the system to prevent torture from happening in the future, or live with the fact that they have no right to criticize other countries for doing what they're doing. Being a world power means leading by example.

**TL;DR:** The US is hypocritical for criticizing other countries for doing what they do, and therefore if the US is justified in criticizing a country over human rights, that country is equally as justified in criticizing the US.

t3_2zqyro	CMV: There's no point in me reducing my carbon footprint.	"(I posted this yesterday but nobody seemed to get it so im reposting it revised)

Either we will solve climate change and other environmental issues, or we wont. My own actions have nothing to do with it. Currently things are getting worse and it's on account of big business, so why the fuck should I be inconveniencing myself? Why polish the brass on the titanic?


I do agree in principle that everyone should be the change they want to see in the world but whether or not I take steps to reduce my carbon footprint doesnt have any consequence. It's an exercise in futility which produces nothing but inconvenience for me with **no actual benefits to anyone.** I would be more than willing to take the necessary steps if it was actually going to make a difference but it wont.

As well as this, I plan to have children, and having children will more or less nullify the net amount of c02 I have avoided emitting.

Are they actually making accurate predictions, or is it just comforting for companies/governments/investors to think that they can predict the future of the economy. Some economists (like fortune tellers) make accurate predictions, but when you have so many people trying to predict what will happen in the future, your bound to have at least one of them predict it correctly.

t3_d22cnl	CMV: We are never going to colonize space	"I really really want to believe that one day, mankind will leave Earth’s cradle and take our civilization into the frontiers of space. Once we establish a foothold there, I believe we’ll truly be invincible as a species. In my wildest fantasies, we will build thousands of O Neill cylinders inside the asteroids of our solar system, and fill them with gardens, farms, factories and millions upon millions of people. Earth’s environment is left to recover, its remaining human population working as custodians of its recovering ecosystem. Eventually, we move these habitats closer to the sun, maximizing solar energy and shortening communication times. We multiply into untold trillions and our industrial capacity becomes enormous. With minimal effort, we even start sending colonists to the stars - and our destiny is all but assured. Within a couple million years - a blink of an eye in cosmic terms - humanity conquers the galaxy. Life is no longer a small, brief chemical flicker in the darkness. It is an established force in the galaxy, visible at astronomical distances as its dyson swarms darken the stars. 

But I have a horrible feeling that none of this will come to pass. Closed ecosystems are already hard enough to maintain on Earth, let alone in an isolated habitat millions of kilometers from resupply. Space elevators now seem theoretically impossible, even if we somehow spin kilometers long carbon nanotubes. Building large scale space habitats would be prohibitively expensive and environmentally ruinous using hydrogen oxygen rockets. (EDIT: ok silly me, forgetting about orbital rings. Thanks Redditor Thoth) Judging from the current trajectory of political and social development, it also seems unlikely that we’ll ever have sufficient collective motivation to populate space. Why live in space when Earth still has so much land and resources? Our bottleneck is not raw materials per se, but the ways with which we are destroying the planet’s resources in our thirst for them - which brings us to the most pressing issue. 

Things are looking grim right now. Ecological collapse is almost a certainty (and has already been happening for some time). Life will go on, obviously, but the Earth’s environment would not be one friendly to human habitation. Failing agriculture, frequent natural disasters, extreme temperatures and water shortages are going to make life incredibly shitty for billions of people. Imagine the Syrian refugee crisis, multiplied a thousandfold. Add on mass unemployment from automation, and a grotesque concentration of power into the hands of the people who own the machines. Every nation on Earth could turn into one of those failed petrostates, where the elites depend not on the productivity of its people, but rather on some miracle resource that requires only a small number of people to extract - like rubber, oil, diamonds, or the cornucopia of automation. And even that would not last. Once the climate completes its transition into something alien and prehistoric, we might see a slow fading of our civilization - a steady drop in population and technological sophistication as the fossil fuels and rare earth metals are used up and agriculture becomes ever more difficult. In a couple hundred thousand years, industrial civilization is forever forgotten. The easily obtained resources, the “low hanging fruit”, dried up long ago. We never have the chance to rise again. Our descendants scrape a living as hunter gatherer foragers - though life is infinitely harder than before, now that most megafauna were driven to extinction, and will take millions of years to return. Needless to say, we never make it into space. Life never escapes Earth’s gravity well. The cosmos will stay silent and dark for eons more. 

If you don’t think climate change is a serious threat, then read this report by IPCC scientists. https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/148cb0_a1406e0143ac4c469196d3003bc1e687.pdf the “lower end” catastrophe involves a billion refugees. The higher end prediction is incompatible with the existence of an organized global community.

I want to believe that something akin to my first scenario will come true someday. I want to believe that our destiny lies in the stars. But the more I read about the immense technical challenges, and the more I read about the imminent ecological catastrophe, the more I despair that we will ever make that dream a reality. If we ever manage to colonize space, our ecological crisis could be solved easily - but we are nowhere near that stage yet. Even a tiny station like the ISS is a monumental undertaking. We’re probably going to need centuries or even millennia to start building relatively self sufficient space habitats - which is time we simply don’t have. To be able to think long term, we’re going to have to first survive the crisis in the short term. But it seems like we’ve left things too late. We’ve already blown our only chance to make things right. 

The specter of the Fermi Paradox hangs over us. If it were so easy, someone else should have already colonized the galaxy. Which either means that we’re alone (or at least very unique), or that interstellar colonization is physically impossible (or extremely difficult) for life forms for any number of reasons. Neither option is particularly encouraging. 

I know it’s folly to trust detailed predictions about the future (though that’s what I spent the last few paragraphs doing) - but I think it’s still worth it to try. It would be great if someone could compile evidence that the future might not be so bleak after all, that we have a chance of surviving this climate catastrophe without declining precipitously, and that space colonization is still a realistic thing to hope for. Apologies if this CMV seems so weirdly specific, but I’m sure there are loads of people out there who are instantly familiar with what I’m talking about, and have a far more nuanced and detailed understanding of them than I do, and can thus clarify and correct whatever misconceptions I may have made above while (hopefully) fleshing our a more optimistic trajectory of our future. In other words, I’m not an expert, just some random pleb with an interest in such things. It would be great if actual experts (or slightly better informed plebs) could weigh in on this issue and CMV. 

Also,  I’ve read responses to similar posts on CMV that go “we were cavemen 10,000 years ago who knows what we will be in the next 10,000” I understand that technological progress can advance rapidly in unexpected directions, but without some concrete explanation as to what it could be, it might as well be wild speculation. e.g. “compact fusion reactors are possible because XYZ” is a good response, not “in 300 years we could invent a fairy dust FTL drive because look how much more advanced we are than 18th century people”. I won’t be convinced by blind speculation about as yet unknown technologies. And just because technological progress has happened before, it doesn’t mean that we can extrapolate that indefinitely into the future. e.g. the speed of planes increased exponentially in the the first three quarters of the 20th century. They barely budged beyond that. We can’t blindly assume the speed they travel would naturally increase because they had increased before.

And just to clarify - I know the title of my post states an extreme position. I regret that a little now. I am actually tentatively hopeful that space colonization is a distinct possibility, but I wanted strong counter arguments to debunk the many reasons why we might never make it there. I seem skeptical because I place stricter criteria on what I consider a strong counter argument - that is to say, it doesn’t involve any hypothetical future technology which isn’t described in at least some detail and involves science with which we have no current understanding. “Alcubierre drives are actually possible because (insert argument here)” is fine. “We don’t know what the next 100 years could bring, look how far we’ve come in the last 100 years” is not. We should have specific arguments, not vague blandishments."	1

The issue, to me, is that in many cases, there are issues that affect ""privileged"" groups negatively as well. I think, if we really want productive discussion on how to make the world a better place, we need to start applying privilege to individual issues instead of creating animosity and stereotypes where they shouldn't exist by attaching privilege to a group even though there are issues that hurt them as well. Sure, maybe there are groups that have more issues that affect them negatively than others, but if you want real equality, you should pursue equality for everyone. Change my view, folks. "	1	
t3_p4zegp	CMV: I shouldn't buy an electric vehicle	"While you're free to use general arguments about why people should buy EVs, there are a few factors about me that make it less appealing to buy an EV for me vs an average person.

* I'm looking to buy a new car soon and would otherwise buy a 35 MPG economy car.
* I'm in the US Midwest where it gets cold (down to -20F in the winter)
* I only drive 8k miles/year
* But I believe climate change is real and a problem

The reason I'm posting is I recently watched [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wcMLFMsIVis) which suggested the two main ways we should help with climate change is stop eating meat, especially beef, and to not buy an internal combustion engine (ICE) car, especially a new one... But I'm actively looking to buy a new ICE car.

# It's a very cost inefficient way to reduce carbon emissions

At 8k miles/year and 35 MPG, that is 230 gallons/year.  At 20 pounds C02/gallon, that is a carbon footprint of 2.1 metric tons of CO2/year.  Even if that footprint was 0 with an EV, the cost to offset this is in the ballpark of $20/year.  So even just the cost of installing a charger at my home, let alone paying $1000's more for the car are a very cost ineffective way to reduce carbon emissions.  I'd be financially better off and the environment would be better off if I just donated $100/year to some carbon reducing effort.

# Cold is a problem for EVs

Cold weather can cut the range of EVs by more than 40%.  Also, the lifespan of the battery is reduced, which can be a major expense to replace.

# I shouldn't buy a tesla

Teslas don't currently have a federal rebate which would help offset the extra $15k required to buy even the lowest end tesla compared to what I'd otherwise purchase. Not to mention that the Tesla Model3 Standard Range+ are already sold out for all of 2021 despite the lack of federal rebate.  Also teslas have bad build quality.  Teslas flush handles can be a problem in the winter too.

# I shouldn't buy a non-tesla EV

Other EV cars don't have access to Tesla's supercharging network, though can still charge at teslas other charger styles with an adaptor just at a slower rate.  The supercharging network is a key way to avoid charging of EVs being a major inconvenience.

# I don't believe the low cost of ownership

While total cost-of-ownership is a major concern for me and there are EV fanboy websites that show a Tesla model 3 is has a similar or even cheaper 5-year cost of ownership to a Toyota Camry, I think some of the other websites out there like caredge are probably more objective (which show the tesla being 1000's more expensive).  Plus, the fact that I drive so little is going to make the added expense of the EV harder to offset.  The 5-year cost of ownership will be $1000's more for an EV.  They don't talk about the risk of needing an expensive battery replacement or the extra cost of installing a charging station in the home."	1

t3_f7uxiv	CMV: Living standards will decline in the future	"The past century is overall a success for humanity, as poverty rates declined while literacy rates and life expectancy improved. However, we face multiple challenges in the future that I believe will negate improvements in our quality of life due to development and technology improvements.

The first, obvious challenge is climate change. While it won't end humanity, it would certainly exacerbate existing problems. It is quite likely parts of India, the middle east, Africa and Central America will become nearly uninhabitable due to heatwaves and water shortages. This will trigger more conflicts and likely a refugee crisis that would make the ones in Europe and the US southern border look tame.  At the same time, countries will have to deal with rising seas, which threaten some major cities and would cause severe economic damage. If this was the only of our problems, we may be able to handle it but there are several more which the media do not adequately discuss.

The current period of economic expansion will eventually end. However, most countries do not have the maneuvering room they did in 2008. Interest rates are already low and most governments are running a deficit and have high debt, so there is also less room for fiscal stimulus. In fact, it is plausible the US or some other major economy may be faced with a debt crisis since their aging populations force them to spend an increasing amount on pensions and healthcare. In all, it seems the next economic crisis will be especially painful for my generation as it would be more severe and have a slower recovery.

Automation is also a concern. The technology improvements would boost the economy but would also displace millions of workers such as drivers and cashiers. It would probably further increase inequality as well. From the research I have read, it is disputed whether automation will result in a net gain or loss in jobs but either way, the job displacements will be a huge social crisis which needs to be addressed within the next decade.

These challenges requires competent governments. Unfortunately, authoritarian governments need to control the narrative to survive so they are unable to deal with their mistakes. Western democracies are crippled by increasing polarization so they have difficulty making reasoned, informed decisions. Instead we get populists who advocate policies that are ""neat, simple and wrong"".

The combined effect of these problems may be enough to reverse the gains we have made. I try my best to remain optimistic but thinking about these problems make it difficult. What have I missed in my analysis that would make the future seem less grim?"	1

Don't get me wrong, I'm all for awareness of a devastating disease.  However, the fact that people dump a gallon and a half of water on their heads, and challenge 5 people to waste a gallon and a half of their own does nothing for ALS.  We are actively persuading people to NOT donate $$ to a worthy cause.  

Most of the videos don't mention that the participant has to donate $10, just by doing the challenge itself.   

Instead, people are wasting precious, drinkable water on a planet where 780 Million people lack access to clean water.  It is the most recent internet trend that will likely expire, in say a month from now.

The anti-SJW niche is very popular (and profitable) but every issue has been discussed ad nauseam by other channels and Rubin brings nothing to the discussion.

So my view is that Dave Rubin is intellectually dishonest because his priorities are aligned with profiting from a niche, not helping discussion.

I am okay with echo chambers existing and being profitable.  We should be honest about what they are.

t3_hyd2ll	CMV: Sending trash into space (especially far from earth) isn’t a bad idea.	"First of all, I must acknowledge the fact that this is hypothetical because we can’t shoot rockets into space efficiently enough for it to be worth it, so I guess this view won’t matter until a time when our resources/tech advance enough to be worth launching thousands of rockets full of waste into space. 

However, once that time comes, I think space is much better option for waste disposal. Earth is not even comparable to outer space in size. Here we are running out of ways to dispose of our waste and global warming is a big problem, but because space is so vast and immense, it’s not like space will fill up. And even if the space around earth gets saturated, it will be thousands of years before it gets saturated enough for the sun to be blocked or spaceships to have trouble getting around (not to mention by then spaceships technology might have advanced)

Or even better, instead of having trash floating around in space, why not dump all the trash onto another planet? No life will be put at risk because there is no life on any other nearby planets.

Materially, the world government has achieved prosperity that most modern nations can only dream of. Poverty and unemployment are nonexistent. Aging has been cured. The upper classes are genetically modified to be stronger and more intelligent. Is such a world really worse than our reality where [a third of the population](https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/18-06-2019-1-in-3-people-globally-do-not-have-access-to-safe-drinking-water-unicef-who) doesn't have access to clean drinking water? And soma is legal and freely available if you have a problem with the lack of material scarcity, unlike modern drugs that are often criminalized. 

The genetic caste system in the book is actually not that immoral. Since the lower classes have decreased intelligence, they aren't able to comprehend how bad their lives are, and thus they suffer less than the poor in our world. Nobody has to worry about having the wrong skillset or being too intelligent or stupid to do a job because they are genetically optimized to perform that job. The upper classes are educated and given the opportunity to live up to their full potential. Since the population is sterilized, the society always has the correct number of people to function efficiently, and demographic crises like those in Russia and Japan do not take place.

The upper classes in Brave New World pass their time by watching porn and engaging in orgies. Huxley presents the lack of monogamy and emotional attachment as a bad thing, but the Buddha said that enlightenment is attained through the elimination of attachment. Although Judeo-Christian morality presents this as a bad thing, there is a fair amount of scientific evidence that humans [are](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/not-born-yesterday/201605/monogamy-is-not-natural-human-beings) [not](https://slate.com/technology/2012/10/are-humans-monogamous-or-polygamous-the-evolution-of-human-mating-strategies.html) [completely](https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/science/monogamys-boost-to-human-evolution.html) monogamous."	1	
t3_2u95d1	"CMV: The 2016 Republican Nominee will have the EXACT same policy/personal positions as the 2012, 2008 nominees. And will lose."	"
My view is that the eventual 2016 Republican Nominee in both economic and social policy will have the exact same positions as the last two elections, thus will lose the 3rd time. Personality wise, they may be very different, but  not policy wise.

The republican 2016 positions:

Economic:
* Supports trickle down economics
* For corporate and high income tax cuts with no equivalent tax increases at all under any circumstances, even at a 10:1 ratio (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKzGZj32LYc)
3. Reduced government spending except for military
4. Promote drilling for oil, no tax credits or subsidies for green energy

Government Policy:
*  Anti Obamacare
* Climate change denial (either it's not happening or not human caused)
3. Social security cuts and Medicare cuts
4. Anti Environmentalism (cut EPA, etc)
5. Anti civil rights (gay rights, abortion/contraception, voting rights, etc)
6. Anti immigration (against pathway to citizenship, against Obama's executive order, etc)

Social Policy:
1. Social conservative christian views
2. Does not believe in Evolution
3. Against gay marriage
4. Anti Marijuana
5. No gun policy reform
6. Cut / Remove the department of education. Implement states rights based education / curriculum. Supports intelligent design taught in the classroom.

And because of all of the above, the 2016 Nominee will lose. Republicans have not learned from the last 2 elections."	1	
t3_pictll	CMV: Individual sustainability is meaningless - the focus should be on corporations instead.	"As a disclaimer, I’d like to clarify my own actions as an individual towards sustainability: I’m aware that I’m still very far from being a zero-waste person, but I consider myself as someone above the average: E.g., I use recycled paper toilet and napkins, metal straws, reuse shopping bags, turn-off all power sockets when possible, do all my payments electronically without physical receipts, prefer sustainable clothing brands, do decomposition, avoid red meat, try 1-2 veggie day a week. and a few other easy things… anyway. 

I do those things because it’s my duty as an individual towards the planet. Still, I believe that my effort plus other individuals’ efforts in this world only counts towards a tiny, tiny fraction of the real impact in the world. They alone are not effective, at all. 

Most gov policies and ads’ focuses are towards individuals. IMO they should target the corporations. - fashion world, transportation, meat/fish producers, tech companies. And I don’t see that happening. 

When I shared this perspective with my friends - that our individuals efforts are meaningless - they look at me as a retrograde/pessimist person.
They say “No, our behavior will ultimately change the corporations attitudes.”
Even if that’s true, it’s not efficient, it’s a super slow process.
For example, in groceries stores, the sustainable section is a small wall of the entire store and are super expensive. I also wonder how ecological are all the logistical processes behind the scenes of the corporations. 

my friends say “But individuals can change the world - look at Greta!” Yes, she is changing the world, but she is the exception, not the norm. And let’s be honest she is not a normal kid - her life purpose is sustainability. She is sacrificing herself for all of us (which I’m very grateful for but it’s as sad as inspirational.)

People say “the way you speak, it demotivates someone to do their own part.”.
And I’m wondering if I’m really a pessimist. That’s not the message I want to pass. I just want to say that “Yes, you should keep doing your part, but do not deceive yourself thinking that’s enough because it is not. Unless the gov/WHO really pressures the private corporations, we are still all fucked up.”

Please, CMV.

---




You didn’t change my view, you’ve done better: you expanded my view! Thank you for that! Here’s my expanded view:

Even if corporations change, most of the time their changes can’t be bigger than individuals’ changes/desires: The public frustrations would increase, the profit would be negative and the business itself would die. 

Changes are happening but they need to respect the individuals' pace, otherwise, the system might collapse. At the end of the day, corporations are the reflection of individuals' needs. Unfortunately, most of them will only change when the majority of us change.

I still believe that individuals' efforts are meaningless in actual numbers. But now I understand why the individuals together are the most powerful way to influence/pressure/allow the corporations to do better and eventually reach the numbers we all needed.

As some said, sharing has a compounded effect — 2 people turn into 4, then 16, 32, 64… so keep sharing and eventually we will stop being a minority... Let's just hope it's not too late by then.

t3_5pyzzu	CMV:Money is the cause of many problems in our world.	"Here are the arguments. The money's part on the argument is highlighted.  
- Climate change: the world's weather is becoming weirder each year because the humanity has been destroying the natural habitats. All the recent years has been dubbed the ""hottest in history"". It's likely that the Middle East becomes uninhabitable in the next century because of the climate change. We could stimulate the society to pass through the necessary changes for the Earth to survive this ""virosis"" called humanity, but enterprises won't make their part because cleaner alternatives (e.g. solar/wind power versus coal/oil) are still **too expensive** to compete with their polluting, more commonly used counterparts. When the clean alternatives are competitive, it will probably be too late. I've heard that the planet could only safely become one/two degrees warmer, and it almost makes me want to have the ability to start a second Ice Age. The fact that the United States elected a climate change denier as their Head of Government doesn't help.  
- Public belongings' management: we could have the private sector manage most stuff and leave to the government only the mission to protect the population, manage the country's diplomatic relations and make/discuss/implement laws and have them followed. But too much of the population (from most countries) is **too poor** to afford the private companies' services (e.g. in my country, the roads in a good state are usually private-owned and have tolls). Also, the government is necessary to give services (like mail) to people in the middle of nowhere because it's **not profitable** for the private enterprises.  
- Social inequality: some of the problems brought by excessive social inequality are high crime rate, usually committed because of """"""""""lack of opportunities and moral roles""""""""""; and the richer people having too much influence, using their ""Cash Force"" to manipulate politicians.  
There are other problems that I can't have too much detail like enterprises having their products made with semi-slave work (or even slave work) in less developed countries because ""**it reduces the cost**"", and bribing (why the hell is lobbying legal in the US?!).  
P.S.: I got it, people. Money is not the problem, just the human nature.

t3_3jznil	CMV: Economic Profit should be taxed at 95%	"Firstly, economic profit is different from what people normally think of what profit means. Economic profit is typical profit (income-expenses) minus opportunity costs. Let's assume that economic profit is calculated using the Economic Value Added formula:

EVA = (Net profit) - (Capital)*(Weighted Average Cost of Capital)

Weighted average cost of capital is essentially the cost of financing a company given the risks of the company not being able to pay the money back and the opportunity costs of not being able to invest in other companies. WACC is typically tied to interest rates. There are ways to calculate WACC.

The tax taxes 95% of all economic value added. Let's also say that some of the tax is used for necessary government spending and the rest is divided amongst everyone equally.

Economic profit arises as a result of market inefficiency. Specifically, it arises when a company's returns are higher than current market returns. This creates a potential for arbitrage. The tax essentially taxes this difference.

Note that pretty much all arbitrage- any way to get money with zero opportunity costs- is economic profit. If I just happen to find $1000 on the street, that is economic profit. The reason it should be taxed is that I didn't really give up anything to take the money- there is no reason for me to get it over anyone else. The same idea is behind taxing economic profits in general; just because someone happened to exploit a market inefficiency doesn't mean they deserve the added money from it.

This is not to say that there is no social value to economic profit. There certainly is some. For instance, if economic profit were taxed at 100% then there would be no incentive for me to pick up the $1000 off the street. There would also be no incentive for arbitrage, which is the primary market force that keeps prices aligned. However, if economic profit were taxed at 95% percent, the incentives to take actions that reduce price differences would still exist.

t3_41mc6t	CMV: Extreme social inequality is the natural tendency of the human species.	"I'm not saying that this is ethical, but simply that such a state did not happen overnight nor by the efforts of a few individuals. It's unlikely that anybody made the conscious effort to setup global equity this way. The society we have today is more a reflection of all our collective human behavior. The manipulative among us have managed to consolidate money and power while the rest of us allow it. Massive inequality has been a persistent societal trait since the dawn of civilization and unlikely to have been a conspiracy to guide human history is this direction. It simply is how we are as a species, much like chimpanzees form troupes where a dominant male monopolizes reproductive rights, so too do humans naturally consolidate power. We don't judge any other species for how they organize their social lives and consider it a natural way of life, yet we refuse to believe that humans could potentially have some genetic predisposition to a specific social arrangement."	1	
t3_c0871y	CMV: We should not impeach Donald trump.	"Political Alignment: Liberal Democrat

Ok, so just so we're clear on impeachment: it will not remove the president from office. That would require 2/3rds of the Senate's approval. I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but the number of twitter comments not distinguishing between impeachment and conviction has me a bit worried.

The thing is, impeachment in election season is highly risky. It's likely that if Donald Trump is impeached, he'll get re-elected in 2020, and now we have to live under that nightmare until 2024.


Ok, so up until this point I've been assuming impeachment won't constitute removal from office. But let's change that. Say the Republican senators are tired of Trump, and vote to remove him from office. We now have president Mike Pence. And he is a *Hardline* conservative. And we can't impeach him too, because Republicans won't have a President Nancy Pelosi.

I am open to change, though. There's something to be said for the moral duty by the house.

t3_m719rl	CMV: Environmental harm should be considered genocide	"Considering that ""we"" are destroying the very system that we are relying on to survive, ""we"" are in fact killing ourselves. Further more, this environmental harm has a skewed distribution, affecting the global population extremely unequally.

Sustaining a ""rich"" lifestyle is done by, knowingly or unknowingly, letting people and nature suffer and die. This is made possible by how we have organised our economic system. It discounts the cost of harm to some and is at the same time concealing the effects of harmful decisions to consumers, limiting the incentive to change. We have built and are sustaining an economic system that can't return wealth to it's subscribers without widespread suffering and death.

t3_fx60l7	CMV: A lack of solutions to resource scarcity means capitalism isn't fit for purpose	"Hello all!

I am not interested in mud-slinging. This a purely intellectual exercise. 

And while I am very much a socialist, I am not suggesting that if we agree that ""capitalism isn't fit for purpose"" that the only solution is socialism. I am not interested in the flaws and advantages of market v state interventions. 

But I have been engaged in many debates with my pro-capitalist friends from across the overton window, from social democrats to free market libertarians. So far, none have provided a substantive answer to my central criticism of capitalism (beyond vague assurances of technological solutions).

Soooo, the central thesis: 

Capitalism, as I understand it (and happy to have my mind changed based on this too) requires the possibility of endless/perpetual economic (GDP) growth. As the coronavirus disruption has revealed, too many people and businesses are one stagnant month from bankruptcy. Capitalism is a system in which a private citizen can invest their capital to create more wealth. That wealth is usually driven by the exploitation of resources (or services, but I will be focusing on resources). The investors take on debt, grow the business to pay off that debt and make a profit. They then reinvest the profits and take on more debt to grow the business more. If they cannot grow fast enough to meet debt requirements, they will go under. 

The system is predicated on the assumption that this process can go on forever, and that everyone in the world can do it. 

I think this is fundamentally flawed. Simply, we already use more resources than the earth can produce in a year. This is already measured by the ""Earth Overshoot Day"", which was September 23rd in 2000 and July 29th in 2019. If we are already using more resources than the earth can regenerate in a year, that is a problem, as a massive chunk of the world is still ""developing"" and the ambitions of the people in those countries are to attain the same levels of excess, comfort and luxury that we enjoy in the West. 

Simply put - capitalism isn't sustainable and it is impossible to provide a Western lifestyle to everyone on the planet without sucking the planet dry. 

I happily and openly accept the many positives that capitalism \*has\* brought to the world. But if the end goal is for everyone on the planet to have access to a life of dignity and sufficiency, capitalism is not fit for purpose. 

This is my view. That there is no way that we can keep growing infinitely forever on a finite planet. Eventually, that will lead to global resource scarcity, resource hoarding by more powerful blocs, and then dystopia. With climate change and future pandemics, ""eventually"" won't take long, IMO.

SO - to change my view you will need to convince me that 

a) capitalism \*doesn't\* require perpetual growth, and therefore we can move to a non-growth capitalist model (which seems like an oxymoron to me). 

or that

b) infinite growth \*is\* possible on a finite planet 

or that

c) there are capitalist solutions to resource scarcity

or that

d) there is something substantive and evidence-based in the vague technological assurances I have received

I'm open to the possibility of other avenues to convince me but can't think of any at this time. 

Thanks for reading and looking forward to a stimulating debate!"	1	
t3_1upw54	"The whole ""simple"" living ideology is basically trying to reverse progress humanity has done during the 20th century. CMV."	"The whole ""simple"" living ideology is basically trying to reverse progress humanity has done during the 20th century. Why? Since there is no nickname for people who think a ""simple"" life is better, let's call them ""Simplists."" Simplists argue that we need to return to a simpler life because of the sake of sustainability. The myth named Peak Oil, is just like the Y2K virus. It sounds real, but it's a type of thing that never happens. Why? Because there's still a lot of oil left in the earth that could last for centuries. What about overpopulation? While oil may not peak in our lifetime, the population will. Of course we still need to switch from oil to renewable energy sources like solar and wind regardless of how much oil is left on the planet, yet does that mean we have to live life like the colonists in the 18th century? Hell no! Instead of surrendering to the earth, humanity need to unite, grow, and build strength against all odds! Humanity must not return to the old days, but rather look face to face at the future! We must never give up convenience! We must never give up on innovation to better the planet! While we need to save the earth from global warming, that doesn't warrant a return to a simple life! The simple life is a life of the slackers, the lazy, and the weak! If we need to get the US out of it's mess, we need to exterminate those who wronged us! Humanity must never surrender to the harmful myth call the ""simple"" life and it's followers! If the Simplists win, humanity would be DOOMED! Innovation would be GONE! And the standard of living would go back to living standards of people in Europe during the dark ages. We must not give up Cars, but we must improve them! We must not give up the Internet, but we must make it grow! We must not give up Globalization, but we must reform it! The Simplists may not be evil, but they are misguided! Mother nature was fine with the growth and prosperity of the 20th century, the greatest century humanity has ever had! We must destroy those who wronged humanity! To save humanity and launch humanity to the stars, we must end all those who tried to end us! We must never give up innovation in the name of sustainability! We must innovate to save earth and humanity itself! We must go to the 21st century!"	1	
t3_26vrea	"CMV: I, as an individual, can not influence any large issue."	"I really struggled with what I wanted my CMV to be. 


Is feminism a stagnate movement? Does recycling have a real benefit? Does voting matter in an area where the majority is against you? Is homelessness an unsolvable problem? Will the wealth divide only grow? What is the point of animal shelters if they euthanize?


So, I searched the sub for those answers and more.


I now realize that there is a prevailing view that spans all those issues: I don’t think that I as an individual, outside of extraordinary exceptions, can make a difference. 


The problems are just too big, for me to make any meaningful, measurable, change.


What can does me tsk-tsking another man for sexism do to really change anything when weighted against millions of minds that need to change?


Look out at the endless fields of trash, and ask what does four plastic bottles and five cardboard boxes a week do to slow such rapid destruction?

Save one kitty cat’s life, and see hundreds of thousands die.


Pay your few thousand dollars of taxes, and watch as the wealthy keep billions out of reach.


Ladle another bowl of soup with the knowledge that that the U.S. produces enough calories to feed the world.


Work your entire life on any one of these issues and die with nothing having been changed.


Often people will say “But if enough people work towards X, then it would be solved!” but they have been saying that for decades, and the message is clear… not enough people care. 


But that’s beside the point. That’s not addressing my concern. I’d never argue that hundreds of millions of people working towards a goal isn’t a powerful force for change. I’m saying, that with out immeasurable wealth, influence, power, or fame, Me… John Blair… will never move any issue in a way that can be measured. 


So, why bother? Why spend your energy, time, and money, pursing something that you will never affect, or if there is a change you’ll be dead or too old to care. Why, for example, adopt a hundred kitty cat’s when I could use that time and money to make a meaningful impact on my life right now? Something real and tangible that I can change… like airplane tickets to Europe? I’ve always wanted to see the world outside of the states and it would be something I could point to and say “look. I did that. I completed that goal, and I am better for it.” As opposed to “I tried to change men’s minds about women. Nothing changed. It was a foolish, ideological, and naive waste of time.” 


So there it is: 


Lacking influence, wealth, and power, I, as an individual, can’t change any big issue in any meaningful way. My time and resources would be better spent elsewhere. Please Change My View.

t3_cu5ukr	CMV: The human race should give up on trying to save ourselves and start deconstructing our presence on the planet	"So, I understands this is an extremely unlikely scenario that wont ever occur, but it's an opinion I've formed due to the huge increase in environmental issues in the world. 

&#x200B;

My opinion is this: We as a human race should stop trying to save ourselves, as the Earth would continue to thrive without us. Instead, we should start deconstructing our cities, taking the world to its original state and removing our presence from the planet.

&#x200B;

My reasoning: The amount of effort needed to completely restore our climate and environment to a sustainable, liveable place exceeds our possibilities. Even now, as I type this, the Amazonia is burning down, and the media is unaffected. There seems to be no reasonable, effective way to restore the damage and overturns hundreds of years of pollution in the time needed for the change to matter. Here's why (With supporting links)

Single use plastics will remain for at least a few decades:

Meat will still be continued as the demand is not decreasing, meaning methane gases and rain-forest loss will continue as to make way for more farm-land:

t3_8ewpuz	"CMV: Attaining biological immortality would not be good for the human species and, ultimately, is a selfish idea."	"Firstly, this post is inspired (and essentially a response to) the following two videos by Youtuber CGP Grey:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY&t=3s
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C25qzDhGLx8


Typically, I love content from this channel, but I find myself vehemently disagreeing with the simplicity of his view about the function of death as a part of life. The following are reasons why I believe death needs to happen. 


1: Immortality will not happen on the flick of a switch. The idea that suddenly everyone will be immune to death, and that the last person will die forever is preposterous. A solution to death by aging would certainly not be made available to everyone at the same time. This would cause widespread issues including backlash (from those whos religion does not agree with immortality, for example) panic, and most likely a desperate struggle for people to gain access to this ""death cure"". The presence of a death cure itself would cause a great deal of chaos, and even if the chaos ends one day, there will be other issues that arise....


2: Having a world where old ideas, practices, beliefs, and ideologies remain (with the people who hold them) sounds awful. The way things are now, new people are being born every day bringing new points of view, movements, and ideas forward. With new generations comes innovation and change. Think of some of the points of view (or ideologies) held by people as early as 20 years ago. Now think about 50 years ago. 100 years? The world we live in has drastically changed with our new ideas. For this reason the cycling of human life is necessary. Those who are old overwhelmingly tend to become stuck in their ways, believing that their longevity makes their points of view valid. Curing a death will either put a halt to this change, or slow it dramatically due to the need to control our population. 


3: Having a cure for death would require us to impose extreme controls on our population. Currently, our population is growing at an alarming rate, while the condition of our planet deteriorates. If we find a death cure, and continue to grow in the same way, we will very quickly outgrow our means for sustaining ourselves. The solution to this problem would be imposing extreme controls on who can breed and when. These things would need to be monitored, and rules would need to be enforced. I don't think I need to describe the dystopian future that this would create. The idea of even being able to successfully control the breeding of 7 billion people is extremely difficult.


4: Genetically speaking, there is no advantage to immortality when it comes to maintaining the life of a species. If there was, there would be far more biologically ""immortal"" species than there are now. Rather than keeping one organism alive for a potential eternity, it is far easier to have that organism breed, multiply, and have their offspring do the same. This allows for the spreading favorable traits, creating new and better version of each organism. 


5: With an eternity to live, inevitably you will get bored. Sooner or later in an infinite time-span you will no longer be able to find joy in what mortal life might have to offer. When you've seen an done everything over an infinite amount of time, you'll eventually decide it's time to check out anyway. 


The only reason people should truly want to attain immortality is to preserve themselves, it's not good for the world, or for the human species. This isn't inherently bad, a desire to live is necessary for life to carry on. But the desire, ultimately, is a selfish one.

2) Claim that he is the sole reason for no global deaths in aviation this year 
3) Promote Sean Hannity (he's still on air?) 
4) Threaten the entire world with a bigger and actually working nuclear button on his desk 

Trump seems to have done absolutely no 'pivot' since his election. in fact, evidence suggests that he's done basically nothing but double-down on positions he campaigned on. 

Recently he seems more on edge. I joked about the caffeine intake he appears to have above, but we do need to as a world seriously consider the fact that when he says,

""North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times.” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!"" 

he's not exactly lying. 

Whether it's a limited nuclear exchange or a large-scale humanity-ending annihilation end game, Trump has had access to one of the most powerful weapons ever in the history of the world since January 20th, 2017. 

What evidence is there (evidence, not opinion) that Trump could NOT bumble his way into a nuclear war? I could really use some of it right now to be able to sleep.

* The climate change crisis currently constitutes the biggest threat to humankind. Climate scientists have been adamant about the severity of this crisis.
* Political stability, **economic development**, and individual liberties are the predominant global values which national governments attempt to at least pay lip-service to, if not dogmatically adhere to.

**My Views/Worries**

Humankind faces a crisis in the form of climate-change which requires immediate and unwavering political willpower to solve. However, humans will vote for their own interests if they are given the chance, and this tendency to favor short-term economic gain and personal freedoms actually results in a failure to adequately address the climate change crisis.

Democracies do not require strong leadership to survive, in fact, weak leadership which seeks to maintain status-quo economic and social realities are extremely successful at winning elections. This presents a problem, if the political elite are unwilling to enforce tough reforms on our societies and economies which depend on the destruction of the earth in order to fuel economic growth and unsustainable lifestyles, humans will ultimately fail to address the climate change crisis.

Where can we find democratically elected governments which have implemented policies which will harm their nation's economy in order to positively address climate change? It seems the very idea of an elected government openly taking action to shrink their national economy is ludicrous to imagine, but if humanity's tolerance of economic pains is so low that we can overlook the climate change crisis in order to maintain economic growth even in ultra-wealthy countries, humanity will fail to elect leaders that can solve the climate change crisis.

Here are some of the kinds of basically revolutionary reforms which could make the biggest impact on anthropocentric climate change as I see it:

1. Strict population controls, including actively incentivizing voluntary sterilization.
2. Strict controls on consumption, intended to curb green-house gas accumulation (e.x. strict meat and fish rationing, strict fossil fuel rationing, strict limitations on industrial production of luxury goods, etc.)
3. Strict controls on overseas shipping, strict regulations on construction of infrastructure which creates green-house gasses, etc.

Policies such as the ones outlined above seem impossible to achieve in a democratic system due to the profound effect they would have on the global economy, and the reactionary attitudes of the typical voter towards policy that could reduce the convenience and luxury of their lifestyle.

I'd really like my view changed, since this train of thought has kept me up at night. I really don't see how someone who cares about the future of the environment (and by extension, our species) could possibly feel anything but powerless to prevent the man-made destruction of our environment. I really can't imagine humanity solving the climate change crisis without the intervention of a higher power, much in the same way that humans don't expect invasive species in the wild to restrain themselves without human intervention."	1	
t3_ca66p4	CMV: Sometimes you need to forgo promoting some social issues so that you can gain enough support on existential threats.	"There are a lot of moral issues that are discussed on social media and in the press, and many of them elicit strong feelings in people.  Things such as abortion, immigration, capital punishment, and many others.   Some of these issues affect a small portion of society, and some a much larger portion.  As of now, there is significant evidence showing that the current increase in global warming is almost completely man made, and will probably lead to catastrophic death and destruction if left unchecked.

We have a current sitting president that has shown an active interest in *not* supporting global warming initiatives.  The president gets a lot of his support from people who voted for him because of his stance against political-correctness, amongst other issues.  ([NPR article on voting patterns and political correctness](https://www.npr.org/2018/12/19/677346260/warning-to-democrats-most-americans-against-u-s-getting-more-politically-correct))

I’m of the mind that it would be smart to hold people less accountable for politically correct speech (as an example) if it meant that those middle of the road voters that just barely voted from Trump in battleground states might be more open to voting for a candidate that is more competent governing the nation and leading the world.  With competent governance we would have a much better shot at tackling very very serious global issues that will affect hundreds of millions of people in critical ways.

On the other hand, I can see why minorities, or disadvantaged people would find any amount of toxic dialog unacceptable, and on principal seek to stop it at any cost, even if that gives power to a populist president who feeds on it through his consistency.

I think people should be willing to forgo battling all moral issues in society to secure support on critical ones, and then build on them over time.  Change my mind."	1	
t3_3kkjjh	CMV: I believe thermal solar power to be the power system of the future.	"Thermal solar power, ( that is using an array of mirrors to heat up a reservoir which powers a turbine) is the best source of power with the most advantages and the least drawbacks.

Electrical solar power has had explosive growth recently, however it has serious problems with both longetivity of the panels as well as supply problems, as fabricating the chips takes a lot of energy and rare earth metals that are in short supply.

Hydroelectric has been maxed out, with almost every major river in the country dammed and it causes massive devastation in the local area.

Tidal energy has yet to be shown to produce substantial energy, will probably heavily effect the local ecosystem, very location dependanat, and has a massive problem with durability as a very large area will need to be taken up, thus having massive corrosion issues.

Fission has a massive public backlash every time anything goes wrong, the supply of uranium is limited until we move to thorium reactors which is slow and difficult, and we still don't know how to properly dispose of it. Furthermore, its adoption in many countries is impossible because of nuclear proliferation fears.

Fusion has still to prove it is more than a pipe dream by even experimentally getting anywhere near as much energy out as energy but in.

Wind energy is extremely variable, expensive, and location dependant, and thus cannot replace the base load of a country.

Thermal solar can go anywhere there is sunlight, can use otherwise unusable land, is extremely resilient (as it is just actuators, a computer, glass, and a steel container), and has no issues with the supply of dangerous or rare materials. Furthermore, a technological breakthrough that would help it (high-temperature superconductors) would allow it to be built in deserts (which have almost constant sun) and then transport the energy to nearby cities.

Thermal Solar power has almost everything you would need in a baseline renewable power, with none of the significant drawbacks of other methods. Please grant that we will need renewable electricity in the future, since that is another discussion.

t3_dad6y1	CMV: You Shouldn't Want To Live On Mars Or Any Other Planet	"Humans have been adapting to Earth for hundreds of thousands of years. It's air, it's water, it's weather, it's day/night cycle ect. 

Even before ""modern"" humans arrived our ancestors from which we evolved roamed this planet and did the same. So you could say we have spent over a billion years ""synchronizing"" with this planet and it's soil.

If you suddenly were to go to Mars , it would completely throw everything out of whack. Human's did not grow to live on that alien planet.  The first generation of people living on Mars will probably suffer great emotional, psychological and even physical pain attempting to live on this unfamiliar celestial body.

t3_b3vr37	CMV: Conservatism is an inherently selfish and societally destructive political viewpoint.	"Conservatives vote to cut taxes on the rich, to deny medical care to those who need it and cannot afford it (without going into insane debt), to deny the right to marry to some members of society, to deny a liveable minimum wage, to strip protections from those who need them, and actively obstruct the process to make voting easier for everyone. Am I living in a bubble so big that I cannot see any real moral benefits to being a conservative? Perhaps my viewpoint is too biased by my media consumption, but it seems that to be conservative is to make/change laws in favor of yourself at the expense of other people. 

A great example would be climate change. Conservatives deny the scientific community’s findings that we are killing the planet with our oil and plastic consumption, yet they want to take no action to save the planet because fossil fuels are still very profitable for them, or that it’s inconvenient for them. Please change my view. "	1	
t3_flkx3r	CMV: Countries who can afford it should increase expenditure in space exploration	"I'll express my argument briefly:

1. Payoff: Investment in SE is a certain economic payday in terms of resource and energy acquisition from other solar bodies.
2. Land: The potential for colonies on other worlds will lessen the dependence and degradation on our home planet.
3. Exploration: The human race's insatiable need to explore and understand the unknown will meet a new frontier, one that may distract from current worldly tensions.
4. Advancement of civilization: the scientific knowledge which will stem from such exploration would be literally otherworldly.

I'm amazed we still have not spent more than a brief stint on the moon. In my view, SE will greatly aid in reducing many of the world's current problems and begin to address greater problems such as over-cultivation, population decline and potential for all out war. Also it would be pretty fucking cool."	1	
t3_67jy81	"CMV: Estuaries are a waste of fresh water, should all be diverted to population centers to human consumption."	"Estuaries? Close them all. I don't get it, how can humanity be so fine with the concept of estuaries? It is HUGE waste of fresh water, after all these campaigns to raise awareness of the importance of fresh water, estuaries are treated as ""natural"", what an absurd. Wasting all this fresh water for nothing? My view on this issue is as simple as you might have expected it, diverting and closing all of them is the only logical solution, and no environmental problems would come from these diversions that would cause any significant damage to be of any concern.

t3_pa42yg	"CMV: Meat of any sort should be a delicacy, not a staple."	"Let's skip past the animal cruelty because we all know it's happening.

We are in the beginning stages of a mass extinction event, and we badly need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of greenhouse gasses.

Fossil fuel is obviously the biggest issue, but so, so many parts of our life depend on it so that's gonna take some time. It would be much, much easier to phase out cow and chicken plants, transition those workers to farming, and start building up a system for a more plant based diet. 

Would it be hard? Of course. Is it necessary? Yeah. 

Nevermind that 39% of the world is overweight. 13% of the world is obese. The *WORLD*. We need some fruits and veggies y'all. 

There will undoubtedly be folks who try to point out that you can live a perfectly healthy life eating meat. You're right. But our planet can't stay healthy with 989 million cows each burping 200lbs of methane every year. 

Others will say ""If I want meat, I have a right to eat it!"". Of course you do. But now it's going to be $50/pound. You'll eat it on your birthday, instead of having it for breakfast, lunch, dinner and snacks. 

In a nutshell: We would all be healthier people living on a healthier planet if we shut down all major livestock production."	1	
t3_gvvjkb	"CMV: there must be an aggressive drive towards environmental sustainability. This may have to come at the expense of economic growth, and in turn reliance on the free market for essentials must be reduced."	"Speaking from a UK perspective here, but I suspect that this is applicable to the USA and other countries as well.

Essentially, it seems that the climate crisis, as it's often described, has become bad enough that it has to be the main focus of governments for as long as nessecary to acheive sustainability. I believe what is mainly needed is as follows:

* Aggresive phasing-out of fossil-fuel based power generation; deployment of, in order of preference, wind farms, solar farms and nuclear generation
* Major increase in working from home to reduce the amount of travel that people are conducting, which should reduce emissions
* For leisure journeys and any remaining commutes, banning of traditional petroleum/diesel-powered vehicles and replacement with either public transport or electric vehicles (EVs), first from city centres with comprehensive public transport and EV charging infrastructure, but ultimately in all areas. This may require government subsidy to persuade people to make the switch. This should reduce carbon emissions significantly, especially if fossil fuel generation is phased out
* Phasing out civil aviation for journeys where the distance is short enough to use land transport. This includes most national and many international journeys in Europe, for example. Aviation produces far more CO2/mile than vehicles or trains. Where the distance is sufficient but no suitable transport link exists, trains or buses must be invested in.
* Introduction of reuse schemes for materials which are environmentally intensive to produce, such as glass and plastic (such schemes are already sucessful in continental Europe, particularly Germany). These incentivise consumers to return used packaging to be either sterilised and reused, or recycled.
* Heavily increased taxes
   * On goods imported by air freight, to reduce fuel consumption
   * On meat, to encourage the adoption of a more environmentally friendly diet
   * On single use items, to encourage conservation
   * On businesses which are not net carbon neutral
   * On luxury items which can be damaging to the environment. Examples of these are high-end vehicles, clothing etc.

I think you get the idea; this is just the tip of the iceberg and there are many more actions which could be taken.

Perhaps the more controversial part of my view is that **if this impacts the economical growth, then so be it. It's inveitable.** Ultimately, which would you rather choose - a thriving economy on a dangerously polluted, dangerously hot planet with frequent natural disasters and who knows what else global warming will cause; or a planet with a poor economy which is safe to live on?

This may mean that many of the essential services which are currently provided by the free market - food, internet connections (which I would argue is an essential service at this point because of its intrumental role in reducing the amount of long distance travel needed), transport and more - may need to be taken into government control and run on the understanding that they will not make a profit. And that's fine. A government is there to benefit its citizens, not endanger them or make profit from them.

To summarise, the economy and technological progression will need to take a hit in the name of ensuring that the Earth is sustainable for future generations. We will need to embrace the fact that the markets will no longer be strong enough to be relied upon to provide anything, But that's the lesser evil in my opinion."	1	
t3_51t2dz	CMV: The world would be significantly better off if people drove just a little bit less. And it wouldn't be that hard.	"This is not a 'give up all cars' post. That's basically never going to happen. This post is: people should avoid driving where it's reasonably practical to do so. 

For example, my view of situations where it's reasonable to ditch a car for a bicycle:

* You have a bicycle and know how to ride it,
* Your trip is less than 5 miles on good roads with no major hills,
* You are carrying less than 10 lbs of stuff and no passengers 
* The weather isn't bad

For buses/trains, I don't necessarily advocate going significantly out of your way to use public transit, but if there *is* a bus or train that gets you from where you are to where you need to be in a comparable amount of time to a car, it should be taken. And there are more and more solutions to the last/first mile problem of public transit appearing every day: folding bicycles, electric skateboards, et cetera.

I think that for trips such as these, and others where not using a car is little to no sacrifice in terms of time or convenience, people should avoid using their cars. 

We'll have a happier, healthier populace--[studies](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11116-014-9521-x) have shown that people who ride their bikes to work are generally happier than those who don't, in addition to obvious benefits to physical health.

We'll make life easier for people taking trips where a car is a significant benefit by reducing two of the major pains of driving: finding parking and traffic. 

We'll reduce emissions not only by reducing overall car-miles, but by making cars that are on the road spend less time stuck in traffic.

And there are a lot of these kinds of trips being made: 2008 data suggests that [more than half of car trips are less than 10 miles](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/pubs/pl08021/fig4_5.cfm). If a significant portion of these trips could be replaced, the impact would be dramatic. If you're willing to look at a source with a more obvious agenda, [63% of trips are under 5 miles](http://www.bikeleague.org/content/national-household-travel-survey-short-trips-analysis)

t3_agsqk2	"CMV: From a purely human perspective, we should tax eliminate subsidies and tax cow meat and milk, and eliminate them entirely from our diets."	"For this CMV, I want to avoid any discussions regarding animal rights and the merits/de-merits of veganism/vegetarianism/omnivore diets. I just want to talk about cows, no other animals, and how they impact humans.

As I write this, there are [94 million cows in the United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/194297/total-number-of-cattle-and-calves-in-the-us--since-2001/). That is roughly 1 cow for 3 people living in the U.S. [The amount of beef consumed in the U.S. per capita is roughly 55 lbs, and the average cost is $6 per lb](http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx). The [average U.S. meat consumer eats 1 cow every 7 years](https://www.upc-online.org/slaughter/2008americans.html), and 41 million are slaughtered every year.

As I'm sure many readers are aware, cows are terrible for the environment because their farts contain methane and nitrous oxide, both of which are more potent greenhouse gases than CO2. [Methane has a greenhouse effect 86 times that of CO2 over a 20 year span](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/). Nitrous Oxide is 296 times more potent of a greenhouse gas than CO2, and it stays in the atmosphere for 150 years. [Cows produce 150 billion gallons of methane per year worldwide,](http://www.cowspiracy.com/facts) and reducing methane emissions would create benefits almost immediately. [The average meat lover would reduce their greenhouse emissions from agriculture by 48% by cutting out cow meat and dairy](http://shrinkthatfootprint.com/food-carbon-footprint-diet). [This will have a big impact for all humans on this planet for probably centuries to come, as it would mitigate lots of the negative impacts of global warming](https://www.ucsusa.org/our-work/global-warming/science-and-impacts/global-warming-impacts).

Cows meat/dairy are one of the most inefficient ways of procuring food, that it would be more accurate to refer to cow meat as flavoring, since it reduces our food and water supply. If you take a look at [table 1 on page 4](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/pdf), you can find that the calorie conversation rate of beef and dairy are incredibly low. It takes 33,000 calories of feed to create 1,000 calories of beef, it takes 200 grams of feed protein to create 10 grams of beef. There is loss of 95-97% calorie/protein from beef. For dairy, it takes 2,500 calories to produce 1,000 calories of dairy, and roughly the same ratio for protein. A lot of nutrition and calories are lost. The [U.S. currently consumes 25.668 billion lbs of beef](http://www.beefusa.org/beefindustrystatistics.aspx), [at roughly 742 calories/80 grams of protein](https://www.nutritionix.com/i/usda/ground-beef-85-lean-1-loaf-yield-from-1-lb-raw-meat/513fceb775b8dbbc210032b6), and given the above conversion rates of 95%/97% calorie/protein loss, our meat production/consumption is currently resulting in a net loss of 635 trillion calories and 41 trillion protein lost. (Calorie loss equation: 25,668,000,000 x 742 x 100/3 = 635 trillion calories lost in beef production) (25,668,000,000 x 80 x 100/5 = 41 trillion protein lost) [The upper most limit recommended for adults is 3,000 calories for active males.](https://healthyeating.sfgate.com/average-calorie-intake-human-per-day-versus-recommendation-1867.html) If my math is correct (it's been a while), we can feed 1 person for a whole year on 1,095,750 calories. (3,000 x 365.25) We would have excess caloreis from not eating beef alone that can feed an additional 580 million people. If we even take a conservative estimate an incredibly conservative estimate that cows are grass fed for half of their lifespan, then that is an additional 290 million people in the world that we could feed from not eating consuming cows/dairy. If the United States alone decided to did this and diverted the extra food to the world's hungry, [we would cut the 785 million hungry people down by about 33%!](https://www.foodaidfoundation.org/world-hunger-statistics.html) That's an entire United States population that we could feed of hungry people simply if we did not produce or consume cows here in the U.S. And [this is without going into the water waste involved in creating 1 lb of beef, which takes roughly 2,500 gallons of water to produce.](http://www.earthsave.org/environment/water.htm)

Lastly, in terms of health, [about 30% of people in the U.S. have a lactose intolerance](https://www.pcrm.org/good-nutrition/nutrition-information/health-concerns-about-dairy), who don't really benefit from having cheese, dairy, butter, or ice cream in the first place (Caucasians = 15%, rest of population = 50--90%). Dairy cows are pumped with hormones and antibiotics in order to make them grow faster and produce more milk, and their general conditions are terrible. [There have been studies linking drinking cows milk with a 44% increased risk of heart disease and even fractures.](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/news/20141029/is-milk-your-friend-or-foe#1) (Webmd article) The [World Health Organization, in a review of 800 studies](https://www.webmd.com/osteoporosis/news/20141029/is-milk-your-friend-or-foe#1) put red meat (which cow meat classifies as) as a carcinogen. Lower meat consumption in general has been associated with lower rates of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, and obesity, and taking our red meat from cows would be the best place to start. 

**Tl;dr:** Lots of citations. Cows meat/dairy is terrible for the environment, it's wasteful of our food resources that could be used to feed an additional 290 million people if fazed out completely, and it's bad for individual health, and we should consider eliminating all subsidies for it, taxing it so it's negative externalities is reflected in the price of the good, and it should be fazed out/eliminated from people's diets entirely."	1

t3_nlrjp7	CMV: Climate veganism is flawed and therefore shouldn't be used as an argument for veganism.	"**Disclaimer:** 

I changed my view. I still hold the believe that veganism is **not the only reasonable conclusion from P1.** But it can and should be used to convince people of veganism, because it is easier to convert to ethical veganism from a climate veganism POV then form a normal diet.

&#x200B;

My main argument

The Climate Argument for Veganism (CAV) usually goes along the lines:


P2 of the CAV, “Animal-based foods have significantly high climatic impacts”, is empirically untrue: not *all* animal-based foods have high climatic impacts. Sustainable freshwater and ocean fish catches, as well as the most sustainably produced liquid dairy products and insects, have a carbon footprint that is close or equal to or even lower than average plantbased proteins.

For example, the estimated emissions (CO2eq/100 g of protein) of Norwegian mackerel and herring are ca. 0.6–0.7 kg \[1\] whereas that of tofu is 2.0 kg \[2\].

Consequently, veganism is **not the only reasonable conclusion from P1.**

Therefore, the CAV is flawed (and by extension shouldn't be used as an argument to promote veganism).

More thoughts on why this is a problem for veganism

and why we should use the ethical arguments for veganism.

* The CAV would lose its power as soon as technological solutions emerged. Nevertheless, the first counterexample of the already existing low-carbon animal-based foods suffices to make the CAV underdetermined for obliging a vegan diet.
* Given the amount of food an individual eats daily, it is unconvincing to argue that coffee milk or honey would make any significant difference on the climatic impacts of one’s diet
* One could too easily argue for ‘occasional carnivorism’ which is not in line with the message veganism tries to carry, which is compassion for animals.

&#x200B;

I still think that veganism has a positive impact on everyones environmental impact in most cases, but its not the single best thing you can do and definitely doesn't lead to (consequent) veganism.

t3_2dkrve	CMV: Dumping a bucket ice water on my head for ALS awareness is incredibly stupid and accomplishes nothing significant.	"I really think dumping a bucket ice water on your head for ALS awareness is incredibly stupid and accomplishes nothing significant.

t3_bry62p	CMV: People don't care enough about climate change in the USA because the main stream media doesn't cover it.	"Seriously, try it. Go to CNN, Fox News, MSNBC, NBC News, ABC News... not a single one will have a Climate Change centered headline, and if they do, it won't be there for more than 24 hours. And you know why? Because 'news' is something that happens like a surprise. The 'surprise' will be on the news for 24 hours because it keeps people's attention, but by the time 24 hours is up the draw to it has lessened and people won't pay as much attention to it- which reduces viewing of the new platform's website, TV channel, etc. So of course the main stream media won't cover it, because it's a long term issue.

 That makes sense, but at the same time that means people won't be aware of it and will be much more skeptical of it when a headline about climate change does become relevant for a few days. I personally believe that Climate Change is the greatest threat to humanity long term outside of possible Nuclear Wars, and it's rather ironic that new sources 'dedicated' to informing the public barely cover an issue that is killing and will kill thousands to millions of people around the world. 

So please, change my view- the main stream media is at fault for the lack of awareness and care about climate change in the United States of America."	1	
t3_331we3	CMV: It is safe for the state of California to assume that current drought will be long term.	"Some people are saying that water cutbacks are unnecessary and that eventual normal rains will make them moot, and thus effectively cost the state billions of dollars. Others think building desalination plants and new downstream dams (like the ones being proposed on the LA River) is a waste of money.

Honestly, I think this kind of attitude is dangerous. Even without global warming, decade long droughts are bound to happen every few hundred years. If Australia didn't cut back on water and build desalination plants during their 17-year drought, they'd have huge issues now. Droughts are not events to be disregarded.

I think the path forward is the one being advocated by the current government, with a mix of cutbacks and new infrastructure.

t3_4t84hm	CMV: Renewable energy will fail if it reaches over half of a region's electricity supply without a monopoly/oligopoly of power suppliers.	"Mainly talking about wind/solar via an economic argument. Could be forced by government intervention, but I don't see how it could economically work in the long-run with high renewables market share. My idea behind the opinion is one I thought of as I hear about Hawaii, New York, and other states looking to get to over 50% of power supply within a couple decades.  In a nutshell, I believe that power prices would collapse to such unsustainable levels once a large renewables market share is reached.  In essence, once installed (which takes a large upfront cost) renewable power (wind/solar) is essentially free to operate. The incremental cost of running a windmill to the system or solar system to the grid is minimal. Power demand fluctuates largely throughout the day, and bidding for power supplies is done at regular intervals for particular time periods.  This means that for a large part of the day, the grid could run entirely on renewable power.  This means that if there are more than a couple of renewables companies, they could essentially bid towards their low variable cost structure (which they all would have). They would likely end up bidding down to negative prices in which they are paying power providers to take the power off their hands. This is due to government subsidies allowing their prices to go negative, and we've even seen this happen last year in parts of Texas. Obviously this assumes there is competition in a fair market system of bidding. The only system I know well is ERCOT, where all electricity providers are paid the price of the highest bid for the needed demand at a particular time period. With this structure, the renewable companies could fight for the market share in much of the day, bidding down to very low prices. For those parts of the day, they wouldn't be making much, if any, money unless there was collusion. The renewable companies would be making real money only in parts of the day when demand requires prices to go higher to more normalized levels where gas/coal/other needs which require a higher variable cost are also necessary.  The government could force this with a price floor or higher subsidies, but that would inevitably mean the average Joe would be footing the bill, which makes little economic sense. Also, this would rely entirely on the government's continued support. I'm a relatively rational guy, please change my view."	1

However, a rise in emissions under an ETS indicates a failure to impliment an ETS effectively rather than a failure of the theory itself.

I would like to see evidence of an ETS where emissions did fall, but other bad side effects occurred, e.g. excessive rise in energy prices as companies offset new costs to their consumers or a big hit to economic growth as businesses fail to transition to renewables quickly enough, resulting in a drop in energy production to meet the ETS cap.

As long as the cap itself is not set excessively high like that of the EUs, it would provide an economic incentive for businesses to reduce emissions and invest in renewables that would fit well into the current neoclassical economic climate. Businesses that fail to reduce their emissions or are structurally less capable of transitioning to renewables will be hit with a cost, but not forced off highly emitting practices.

All of this does rest on the government's ability to accurately monitor the emissions of polluting businesses (not self-reporting), and be able to enforce the ETS on businesses that fail to stay below their cap or try and cheat the system. If technology is not yet at the stage to take accurate measurements of emissions I would like to see that too."	1	
t3_35iazc	CMV: The UK should keep its trident nuclear weapons programme	"So I'm all for ending nuclear proliferation. I think the world will be a better, safer place without nuclear weapons. But, I still think that the UK should renew trident.

In the TV debates, Natalie Bennett said something along the lines of, ""What is the point of having a weapon you are never going to use?""

To answer that question, I came up with an analogy. Having nuclear weapons you'll never fire is like owning a gun without bullets. If someone else points a gun at you and tells you to do something, you can just point your gun right back at them and say, ""no."" They don't know you won't fire, and you don't really know if they could. Reducing the number of nuclear weapons won't work in a lead-by-example way. Instead we should remain armed, but gradually try to reduce the number of nuclear weapons worldwide until it's safe to give up our own.

What with global warming, diminishing oil reserves and automation preparing to put social, economic and political power structures to the test in the coming decades, I think it's important that the UK remains armed.

t3_7hdfc7	CMV: There is no intrinsic value in human life	"When I say human life I mean the totality, for the species. Not the individual.

Here's what I'm going at: We often talk about the future of the Human Race, and how we'll need to leave earth and travel to other planets if we want humans to keep existing. The thing is, I see no reason as to why we must try to ensure the survival of the human race, as of today. We can't work together as a species, and something as simple and stupid as the place where we're born is enough to separate us so immensely that we act as if a Brazilian Human is essentially different from a Japanese Human. We are still too stubborn to recognize the characteristics of our species (such as stubbornness) that we could use to improve ourselves and work better together.

We still have huge amounts of people denying science and fighting over what religion is right, even in aspects we know them to be wrong. We don't trust each other. And as someone who believes in some form of capitalism, I think we're reaching the worst that it has, to the point where it seems we really are artificially splitting ourselves more and more.

Take nuclear weapons, for example (and I was discussing this with someone else on another sub, so if you were talking to me about non-proliferation, hey, whats up?) We've all come to agree that nuclear bombs are extinction in a box, and decided that no one can make any more nuclear weapons, to make sure that we don't end up killing ourselves. Yet, the countries who do have nuclear weapons refuse to give them up. Why? For the reasons I talked about before: We don't trust each other, so how can the USA make sure that, if they destroy their nuclear arsenal, Russia won't just take over the world under a Socialist Dystopia? We also want to have an advantage over others. If other countries don't fear you, then you can't just have what you want.

Even our best hope of achieving real unity as a species, the UN, is corrupted. There are five countries with veto power in the security council, that use that power for their own benefits.

With all that considered, I truly don't see the intrinsic value in human life that would make me say: We need to protect it at all costs. In fact, I believe that if we started to act like a species that deserves to stay alive, then doing so would be much simpler: if we worked together for science and technology, we could be so much more advanced by now, and there I have no doubts that we would advance at a much faster pace than we are advancing now. We could really solve the problems of inequality in the world, rather than just focusing in our own back yards, and that in itself would push our progress in so many areas.

As a final note, I'd like to say right away that I won't give much importance to religious arguments. I don't believe in God or any such thing (I don't deny any of that either, I just believe it's an unnecessary improvable/unfalsifiable complication of the universe), but I do believe that if there is a God such as most religions describe, then it doesn't really give that much value to human life either.

I don't think we should just kill ourselves and be done with it, I think we have to keep striving to reach this ""utopia"" (which should really just be the norm, I mean, what is more basis than asking that humans treat each other as humans?). But I think it's important to note that the survival of the human species is only worth anything as long as it's used to pursue this goal, and not because humans should survive at all costs. This means that any action/decision that makes it harder for this end goal to be reach, with the pretense that it is to ensure the survival of the human race, is intrinsically invalid. If our incapability of reaching that goal leads to the extinction of humans, then tough luck, and lets hope that the next species that comes up fares better than us, and that we can serve as an example to some future civilization that finds our remais.

I think it would be extremely sad if we didn't manage to live to traverse the universe, and to meet other species, and to be a part of all of the great things that we could do with our species. But I think it would be even sadder if we started to colonize without first being capable of living as one. If we're having trouble doing it on earth, where we're super close to each other, and every decision taken impacts the lives of everyone else, things would only get harder if we separate ourselves by planet, and solar system. Can you imagine what would happen when humans actually got a few years of evolution so that the human race on earth is actually different from the human race on mars? Or when they're so far away that it becomes hard to argue in anyway that we're similar to them."	1	
t3_oe7spt	CMV: America’s “NASA” should be a tiny department UNTIL U.S. poverty is near eradication and our negative effect on our climate is minimal	"Watching politicians and the rich spend hundreds of millions of dollars on spaceships and probes sickens me. On Earth, nearly 10% of people live in extreme poverty. Slavery and child workers still exist. Even in America, 1 in 7 live below the poverty threshold. 

So why are we spending roughly 0.5% of the U.S. federal budget on NASA?

I can understand curiosity about our universe and our place in it. Knowledge is a beautiful thing, and people will go to many lengths to attain it. But spending billions of dollars on space research and explanation every year is disgusting to me. We are prioritising looking around at fun things in space over our OWN citizens suffering - there’s no excuse. 

The climate crisis is already here. We are already seeing the effects of extreme weather.  Ironically, NASA itself is spending money on looking at climate change on our own planet, one of the few programs I actually support NASA continuing right now. The U.S. is a major contributor to pollution and, consequently, the destruction of earth. So WHY are we spending tens of billions of dollars on NASA??

I honestly don’t really think space exploration should be a huge concern; we have only explored 5% of our oceans. I believe our own planet is far more interesting to explore than our solar system - at least we know there is life we will find instead of, at best, evidence water ONCE existed. How do we know the moon’s surface better than the bottom of our own oceans?

Yes, NASA creates jobs that help our economy (thanks, Dad). But ANY jobs created help the economy. We could improve homeless shelters, give more in welfare money, redesign our police force that uses violence disproportionately against POC, and phase our nation out of using gas, but instead we spend our money on spacecrafts. There is no way to justify spending so much on space exploration in our current state.

t3_4243ln	CMV: A Cabinet of Science and Space could benefit America greatly.	"I believe if in 1996 we had an actual federal department of science and space.

Global warming could have been noticed on a greater scale. Global warming is a big campaign point in 2016 without a department of science not without reason. Higher temperatures, increased acidity and steady melting of ice into the oceans, imagine the impact of a twenty year head start!

 We're also still discovering planets in our own solar system. Technological advances in health, agriculture, civil rights as well as other cabinets have had a huge boon to grow. I believe we should invest in space exploration. That's another twenty year gap we have for space. We are literally a rock spaceship in space powered by finite energy. If we could achieve sustainable life in space, we could achieve sustainable life on Earth."	1	
t3_97fqc2	CMV: The United States of the World will be good in the long run	"This is a very hypothetical situation but bear with me.

Imagine that tomorrow, the us conquered the world through non nuclear means and created the united states of the world. 

The creation of the usw will cause the following problems in the short term:
People in conquered countries wanting their independence would probably try to revolt.
There is a massive cultural, language barrier in a single country.
Those who were not in the USA will not have any voting right or will not have the 2nd amendment. They do not have the ability to vote because otherwise those disagreeing with the US conquering the world(probably the majority) would simply vote a candidate that will reverse everything to the way it used to be.

Now, I understand that all these problems I listed are bad. However, I believe that in the long term all these problems will disappear and the usw will make the world a safer place.

The usw should have a massive assimilation campaign in schools of the whole world such that everyone learns english, important values, etc.
After a century or two, the whole world should be able to get all the rights and there shall now be no more distinction between those who had been from the USA.

The creation of the usw will solve numerous problems in the long run:
- no more wars - be it trade or military 
- a massive reduction in poverty
- a single language over the whole world further increasing mobility
And many others

I do realise that there may be some disadvantages even in the long run.
For instance, a Snowden of this world would have nowhere to go.
However, to me, the advantages far overweight the disadvantages.

To cmv, you do not need to argue about the feasibility of the USW (I know it will never happen and this is just a hypothetical situation). You only need to show me that the creation of the USW would be worse than the actual system."	1	
t3_6m7t1o	CMV: Evidence-Based Policy is Overrated	"I participated and was a volunteer for the Science March in Amsterdam. So don't get me wrong, I think that evidence-based policy is important. However, I have come across the idea that all policy must wait for evidence, which, as a designer, I think is misleading.

Recently, I attended a research conference for education. This conference is organized by an organization that educators can tap to provide data for lesson plans. That's great, it really is. The conference started with a so-called pitch round, where different researchers pitched data and it's importance. That is where my red flags began raising, though.

The researchers were presenting data of the past two years that they had collected. For example, data suggested that children like using paper over digital tools for certain tasks. Which is fair enough advice. However, the data was being presented as conclusive. Because of it being a pitch, people had to be hyped up by the data, so the data was being presented in such a way that it seemed like this was simply how brains were wired.

The thing is; many data points aren't useful in a single snap-shot. You have to collect data over many years to find a trend and even then, you cannot infer from the data what the causal link is most of the time, because of hidden data that you didn't know was relevant until after you've seen the other data.

So, all I could think during the conference was 'all of this may change in six years when children have grown up with digital tools; teachers are being set up for failure here'.

Which is the crux of my argument. While a lot of evidence based policy, like climate change, is based on evidence that has already been collected, you cannot demand that all policy be backed with evidence. That means that you'll always lag behind the reality.

Take the education for example. Let's say that it took 2 years to collect the data that learning to read is easier with paper tools than digital tools, but expanding vocabulary is easier with digital tools than paper tools. If you base policy off of this data, even corroborated with studies from the same period, you'll be lagging behind, since the educators first need to change their lesson plans and learn to educate in a new way. For the sake of extrapolating this argument to other areas, let's make the unrealistic estimate that it takes a year for the new policies to become nation-wide.

Already, we'd be lagging behind 1 year. By the time that we get the results in, it might be another 2 years. So, already, we are far past the time period it took to collect the data in the first place, so another study may have come out that contradicts the first one, not because the first one was wrong, but because the second study described the applicability of the tools with new technology and a new level of digital literacy in children.

It becomes a rat race of running after the facts. Instead, if you want better results, it can be better to try and find ways to make existing methods more efficient. To look at how school buildings are designed and to reduce the amount of time is spent wandering the halls between classes. Policies can be designed with economic theory in mind for how much incentives children have to pay attention in class if their digital devices can provide them with more entertainment than the teacher can with no apparent cost from getting caught.

Those changes in policy don't require evidence, so much as they do planning and a good kind of sense. You can argue that they are, indirectly, based on evidence, but that is a different category of motivating policy change than we see in for example the climate change debate or occupational risk policies. And even the latter is still mostly based on anticipation and prevention rather than measurement.

Maybe I'm not seeing the big picture, though. Maybe evidence-based policy has merits over other kinds of policy. I think that evidence-based policy is predominantly good for things we have data for over a large scale, not local policy.

t3_2yuey9	CMV: Terrorists don't deserve a trial	"
So this may be a bit of a controversial opinion but I think terrorist don't deserve a trial, or any other rights from the country they decide to work against. Most terrorists hate the country that they are working against, so why do they get to take advantage of that country's rights? One reason I say all rights and not just a trial is because not to long ago a kid from around where I live started making bomb threats saying he was going to blow up his school, but when he realized he was going to get into serious trouble over the entire thing he started saying that Free Speech protected him from any repercussion from the incident. 

You might say 'When the government can pick and choose who can take advantage of its rights, they are no longer rights but privileges' which is correct, but they are already privileges. Yes they are labeled 'Human Rights' and everyone is 'born with them' but that is not true. if they were Human rights everyone, everywhere would have them but they don't. The rights we have in this country, and most other countries, are privileges.

t3_hnuoa2	CMV: We are putting too much effort into changing plastic items into biodegradable items and not looking at the big picture	"We are putting too much effort into changing plastic items into biodegradable items and not looking at the big picture. I'm not against trying to make the world a little less pollution free, but I think we are not looking in the long run.

Yes, a lot of people started using paper/metal straws and a lot of companies are starting to use more biodegradable plastic/material. That's cool, but what about the items that can't be so Earth friendly and are really popular? Like diapers; thousands of kids are born everyday and starting from a few days old, they are wearing diapers. Do you know how many times you have to throw them away because they are not poddy trained? Also, they are usually very thick to prevent leaks.

Or how about clothing? Not only kids grow out of them, but everyone does. I know, ""just donate old clothing/sew the rips!"" But there is a point where you can't donate clothing or fix that hole. Winter coats especially, one big enough rip and it's just easier to throw it away and buy a new one.

There are even more items like plastic bags (I know some states have regulations but not every state), fast food bags and napkins, certain single use plates/cups/utensils.

There is 2 things/ways I think we should be doing instead of the above:

1: Find a way to turn non-biodegradable material into biodegradable material. We have found ways to make plastic MORE biodegradable but never fully. I think we should study how to do that. Find material that is strong but fully biodegradable under certain circumstances (ex: just add blank)

2: Find a way to change it into something we use enough to meet the income of non-biodegradable material. I really don't know to explain this idea well but it kinda speaks for itself. Maybe with with certain chemicals, we can make a new type of material that we can use in a lot of day to day items?

t3_5kj3z7	CMV: The wildlife population dropping by 60% is totally fine.	"There is a post in r/news that says that wildlife has dropped 60 % in 40 years due to human activities. I think that's not surprising, and not really a problem.

We humans have developed at an incredible rate, and in doing so we've taken a lot of the world's land, fresh water, minerals, and other resources. Because the earth has limited resources, everything we took is something wildlife doesn't have, so the wildlife population started dwindling.

This reduction of the wildlife population has had 2 nasty consequences. First, a massive ecological disaster is threatening us. We are damaging the global ecosystem, which we need to live.

Second, the disappearance of species and ecosystem. An animal specie is a unique design which nature has spent millions of years developing, and it's loss is a tragic loss of memory and information, not to mention the beauty of the natural world that we are destroying.

However, I believe that if we are careful and environment friendly, we can reduce the wildlife population without hurting either of these systems. We can make every ecosystem smaller, but without destroying any ecosystem or any individual specie. And we can rebalance the global ecosystem so that it works with us. In fact, we have to, because the human population is so [big](https://xkcd.com/1338/) that we simply cannot not massively impact the ecosystem, no matter how we live. So we should just accept that we'll have reduced the wildlife population, and try to make it healthy even though it's smaller.

t3_a39qlb	CMV: Conservatism is facing death in the United States of America.	"We've just had a midterm election in the United States, and things couldn't look worse for the future of the Republican Party and conservative politics. A left-of-center Democrat came within three percentage points of winning a Senate seat in Texas. Democrats gained nine governorships. And when considering just the popular vote for House and Senate candidates across the country, Republicans took a huge beating.

The Democratic Party as a whole, meanwhile, is becoming less and less cautious about embracing socialism – just look at the embraces they've given to self-identified socialists like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasia-Cortez. They wouldn't do this if they didn't know it was ""in.""

Finally, consider who the biggest rising voting bloc is in this country: Millennials. [The nonpartisan Pew Research Center has found that Millennials are by-and-large left-leaning on most issues and in most identities.](http://www.people-press.org/2018/03/01/the-generation-gap-in-american-politics/)

All of these factors combined lead me to believe that ""a conservative mainstream"" is headed for the grave in the U.S.; conservative outlets may still exist, but they will never be accepted by any of the mainstream of society. The center in American politics will shift leftwards, and conservative ideas will become permanently irrelevant. Understand, I'm not saying this is a good or a bad thing, but this is the reality the conservative movement and Republican Party will have to face.

t3_p2433x	CMV: All humans have a strong negativity bias and that's the reason why many people support depressive thinking in the face of climate change.	"The negativity bias, according to [healthline.com](https://healthline.com), is the ""tendency to give more importance to negative experiences than to positive or neutral experiences.""

It is also the ""tendency to focus on the negative even when the negative experiences are insignificant or inconsequential.""

The negativity bias is what happens when you look at a situation, and you only see the negative. The negative stands out immensely and now you can't see any positive answers or routes. The negative is the only thing that matters in your mind now, so you barely think about the more positive and neutral aspects of your situation.

All of this negativity about climate change is unproductive and unhelpful. If a person really wanted to save the children and change the world for the better, they wouldn't be pushing this doom and gloom crap so hard. It's the same thought process as ""I'm going to die anyway, so what's the point of being happy today?"" It doesn't help you or anyone else, and it can actually cause depression in other people too. All you did was spread your negativity and toxicity to other people. That is actually not a good thing, believe it or not.

In fact, I would argue that it's selfish to say all of this crap about climate change, children, and death. Why can't children have a good life right now? Why can't you give a child a happy life, despite the situation? Millions of people live in severe poverty, and poor people have always existed, but many of them have given their children love and joy. The only person stopping you from doing good is yourself. You are the one stopping yourself from being kind and loving; it isn't the climate or the trillionaires stopping you. Instead of inseminating or giving birth, just adopt a child. The orphans will need parents during the before and after. You are so busy thinking about people who don't even exist, that you forgot about the people who do exist or will exist. Natural disasters and war aren't good reasons to abandon life.

Pushing this depressive, apocalyptic thinking puts a road block in front of lots of people. It stops them before they have even made an attempt. And honestly, so what if the planet will die. So what if people will die! Yes, that's messed up. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't live the best life you can live in the face of death. And many people who are complaining about climate change haven't had any serious losses because of pollution and global warming. So why would you want to force people to feel hopeless and scared when nothing has happened to them?

Humans have a strong tendency to obsess over and believe in the worst possibility they can imagine. I believe that is the easiest thing humans can do. It is extremely easy to come to the conclusion that everything is hopeless and we're all going to die. Or we should all die. If the planet does die, and humans die with it, does that not give you reason to live life to its fullest? Would you tell a cancer patient who has 10 or 20 years to live that he should just give up? He should just waste his life on feeling depressed and scared?

It has been said many times that if you or someone else tells you ""You are going to fail"" or ""Something will go wrong"" then those things will come true. Personally speaking, there is a lot of truth to that. If you tell yourself something, and you do it repeatedly, it's going to have negative effects just like you predicted. It doesn't do you or anyone else good.

This whole conversation is about a predetermined prophecy. It's pointless and stupid. Enjoy your life while you can. Help people. Don't tell people to feel depressed and fearful. (It seems misery loves company, though).

Point is, don't push your beliefs and toxicity onto other people. It is selfish and it ruins life for people. Humans die no matter what is happening to their planet, so why give up now? Just do what you can when you can, and that applies to climate change doomers.

2) When we clean other things like...clothes, dishes, etc., we use warm water to make the cleaning more effective. Warm water breaks down stuff so much better/faster than cold water. So why wouldn’t we expect the same for our teeth?

t3_b289d0	"CMV: In practice, there is no one who is so evil that they cannot be made good"	"Here's what I mean by ""in practice"":

If you pressed me on it, I would have to agree that there probably exists someone in the world who is so evil that they cannot be changed. This is more a statistical question than anything else -- with more than 7 billion people on the planet, and an assumption that there exists some neurological anomaly that makes someone unrepentantly evil, it would be reasonable to assume that there's at least one person with that neurological anomaly.

But I do not believe that one can reasonably look at any *individual person*, and say ""that person is so evil that they cannot be made good"". ""They're a lost cause"". ""There's no point trying to help them, they're always going to be that way"". Etc. The chances of you being right when you say that are so infinitesimally small, that it's better to treat everyone as someone who can be helped.

This opinion contrasts sharply with the views of a lot of people on the internet, it seems -- ranging from ""this murderer deserves the death penalty"", to ""there's no point arguing with racists because they're just hateful"", to even ""there's no point helping the homeless, they're all just entitled and lazy"". In all of these cases, I believe that, while there is a tiny chance you might be right, you can never have the *confidence* to declare this, especially when the alternative is the opportunity to genuinely help someone and improve the world.

Change my view :)

(N. B. There's no need to delve into the definition of ""evil"" here. We can at least mostly agree that there are some things that are ""obviously"" morally bad, and focus on those.)"	1

People should have the right to know everything that goes into their food, and to choose everything that goes into their bodies. In 2007 President Obama promised to label GMO’s in his campaign, yet nothing came of that promise. This clearly indicates, I think, that the government believes GMO’s are safe and healthy, even though certain studies are proving otherwise. I understand that GMO’s provide a big business. By labeling them on food, sales of GMO products would certainly go down, but I believe that the health of the public is more important than the monitory value GMO’s provide to the government and other businesses.

Right now, we have more than enough oil, which is why prices are low, but it's kind of like having more food in the pantry than you can eat in a single evening. It looks like a lot, you might even be tempted to throw a party, but when you have no reliable way to restock the pantry, you should treat it like a precious resource.

Even assuming we'll beat climate change--[and there's zero evidence that we will](https://skepticalscience.com/ipcc-global-warming-pause.htm)\--there are no renewable energy resources which can sustain the large, expensive, oil-intensive industries that provide most of us food and water. And forget about electricity, the new dark age we are entering might be literal.

A 1-to-1 replacement of fossil fuels and renewable energy is impossible, [as Germany has found out](https://wattsupwiththat.com/2019/01/01/can-wind-and-solar-replace-fossil-fuels/). A lot of people point to the promise of [totally unproven future technologies](https://medium.com/wedonthavetime/progress-on-carbon-co2-capture-1ff84b1164c4), but that's kind of like trying to pay your landlord by showing him all your job applications--our planet does not care how hard we try. And it's irresponsible to expect scientists to solve all your problems for you, especially when there are zero scientists telling us to bet the fate of humanity on their research.

Our only option is a massive reduction in the quality of our lifestyles.

Our lifestyles are **not sustainable**, which, by definition, means that at some point in the future they are mathematically required to stop. When they stop, we're talking about a reduction to pre-industrial levels, the last time human civilization had no oil, in which a large majority of humans engaged in sustenance farming. The problem right now is that we've forgotten entirely how to farm, and many people faced with transition from a relatively luxurious high-tech lifestyle to sustenance farming would gladly choose suicide. This is not to say it will be easy even for those eager to return to the earth, either. Farming is hard, and [becoming a competent organic gardener takes five to ten years](https://www.resilience.org/stories/2010-08-26/care-and-feeding-time-machines/). And even those with the time, and the foresight, and the desire to make this transition may have no access to land to actually grow the food. Land is ridiculously expensive, and the assumption of easy access to fossil fuels is baked into the price of land. 

And you might think we have a full 48 years to adapt (2067), but the reality is that, at some point, oil will be a strategic asset that only the military (which is impotent without it) and the ultra-rich have access to, at any price. Even before then, it will be priced beyond affordability for most Americans, who will suddenly have no way to get to work and nobody to work for, hence the broad range of 20-40 years. This places the end of civilization, potentially, within my lifetime, how about you?

Is there reason to be optimistic? Absolutely. Millions if not billions of humans will be skilled and lucky enough to adapt and survive, but they won't be the members of a global civilization and they won't be members of any civilization we would recognize. Importantly, they won't have our values. They may not think that having access to luxuries like entertainment and transportation and global communication are a good thing, since they will be living in the wreckage of world created from those desires.

If you want to belong to a world that won't die before you do, you may need to change your values as well."	1	
t3_jz4qzr	CMV: Banning Juul flavors does not effectively combat teen nicotine use	"Smoking is bad I know, especially for kids. That’s not the point of this. 

Banning flavors that appeal to younger users doesn’t make kids quit - they just switch to one of the remaining flavors. 

If kids have been able to purchase a JUUL or their fruity JUUL pods somehow before (assuming the merchant was checking ID as required), what is stopping them from continuing to purchase? There’s plenty of other low profile vaping devices available at gas stations. You can easily purchase vape devices online (yes I know you have to verify your age). 

And you also run the risk of kids switching to cigarettes

t3_2ygo78	"CMV: War should be fought by weapons embargos, NOT violence and military campaigns."	"My proposition is simple:

Wars are fought with weapons. They are literally the fuel for all modern conflicts. A practical and effective solution would be a multilateral approach at demilitarization and weapons embargos. 

I say this as a general point as an emphasis on the ideological framework of waging war, not as some easy solution to the problem. I contend that serious movement behind this front will dramatically reduce armed conflict. 

Currently, western ideology for fighting wars is overwhelmingly centered around use of force (Syria (2015), Iraq (2003), Afghanistan (2001), Bosnia (1995) etc...). This is obviously not optimal - new ideas must be implemented that efficiently and non-destructively (as possible) reduce the threat of war. I think this can be accomplished with a massive demilitarization campaign. 

I will be back later to respond to queries!

Change my view."	1	
t3_23615e	CMV: I honestly dont care about the environment nor any wild animals (not PETS)	"1) Why is it so bad that the great african-asian-black-white-giant-super-endangered-albino animal I give two hoots about is dying out? Over the millions of years countless species have been going extinct and new ones have been evolving. This is part and parcel of nature. I could not be fucked to care about (or worse spend our scarce resources on) some other species suffering when there is already so much to do and fix about our own species (poverty, hunger, human-rights abuse etc.)

2) It is almost egotistical to think that we humans can ""destroy"" our planet. The earth is fucking over 4 billion years old. Humans (even if we count our ancient ancestors) are at most 2 million years old? (someone correct me if I am wrong here) which is at BEST a blink of an eye in the grand scheme of things. Modern civilization is at best a true ""jiffy"" for the earth. Yes things may be bad while humans are still around. But in no way or another are we able to ""destroy our planet"" till it cannot recover (Things might be shittier for the future generations due to pollution but that is not the argument here. Environmentalists cry for the ""damage"" we do to the earth not the fact that we are going to leave a temporarily shittier earth for future generations)  For goodness sake, the earth has been through MUCH MUCH MUCH worse things (google extinction events) and have come out on top.

t3_aa08qw	CMV: Anti-GMO people are worse than Anti-Vax people.	"(disclaimer: This is more about Anti-GMO activists than people that won’t eat GMOs. Most of those people are just ill informed.) 

Vaccines save lives, and anti-vax’ers endanger the lives of their families, but most Anti-Vax decisions only effect a small percentage of people. Sure anti-vax kids can break some herd immunity, but most people around anti-vax’ers will not experience negative reactions. The same can not be said about anti-GMO’ers. 

Being Anti-GMO, is extremely self centered. You would rather people in other countries die than eat food that is slightly different. We could prevent a lot of unnecessary death if people would give up their misguided ideals. 

Firstly, GMO’s are practically always safe, and are definitely safer then our current methods of food supplies. Just like vaccines, we’ve been using GMOs for decades, but people only care about it now because of ignorance about technology. It’s just food that has been modified to be better. Just like vaccines, they were made to better the world, not kill it. 

Secondly, GMO’s save lives by improving the way that food can be grown.  Third world countries have to destroy lives and the environment with pesticides just to grow plants.  These less developed pesticides can cause cancer for those spraying it and can drain into the water. Of course most of these pesticides are not in our food once it comes to us, but the workers are still being introduced to constant high doses of chemicals. 

GMO’s on the other hand can be made to naturally reduce pests, making pesticides obsolete. With GMOs, workers will not have to be introduced to pesticides and would not have to suffer like the currently do. It’s better to use technology that is nearly completely safe than to continue to use technology we know can be deadly. 

Lastly, GMOs can help reduce world hunger. GMOs can create crops with higher yields with higher shelf life’s to allow for more food supplies to starving countries. GMOs can be made to survive harsher climates and smaller growing areas allowing for more widespread farming in places like Africa and Mexico. This allows third world countries to receive the necessary fruits and vegetables of a sustainable diet. We could save tons of lives by using safe GMOs. "	1

t3_ptjwjd	"CMV: The US is in trouble, and it's gonna get a lot worse before/if it gets better"	"The United States has found itself in a situation where we have about 30% of the population who haven't gotten a free, life-saving vaccine.  In 2021.  

Vaccines have previously been created to help prevent such horrible diseases as polio and measles and poxes... but for whatever reason, this is something people are taking a stand on.  

We have politicians, and political consultants, such as Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Josh Hawley, Lauren Boebert, Marjorie Taylor-Greene, Roger Stone, Steve Bannon, that have been found to foster conspiracies and stoke insurrection on a federal level.  There's a growing cult and culture of anti-science, anti-intellectualism that's threatening to tear this country apart.  And nobody seems to care.

Reproductive freedom is going backwards.

Voting rights, going backwards.

Somehow a small group of Americans are able to dictate the entire course of this country.  And it's not the smart, empathetic group of Americans.

Under this environment, free healthcare, free education, will never happen.  Police reform will never happen.  The left either don't have the power to change things, or if they do, have enough fence-sitters to not change things.  

The world is burning up, and we'll never do anything about it.  The old rich corporate heads will be long dead, and unable to see or care about their grandkids getting skin cancer for being outside for five minutes.

Really, the most harmful wings of the GOP have been in power pretty much since Reagan.  Clinton and Obama were center-right, and only seem to be able to pass half-measures on issues like ""Don't ask, don't tell"" and ""Obamacare,"" instead of full-on progressive policies, a lot of which other countries have had in place for decades.  Somehow that's impossible here.

I think the next midterm elections are gonna be rough for democrats.  People are being worn down, numbed.  The ""mass sickness named after a beer"" is still here, and likely won't go away anytime soon.  We need people to cooperate, and they're not cooperating.  There's been no repercussions for those who stoked the attempted coup in January.  Some low-level rednecks will be put in jail, but nobody with actual influence or power will see any punishment.  Every day on the news, someone with power is being charged with something, never goes anywhere.  

And if things get even worse?  The world moves on and we're still stuck in the midst of ""the illness named after a beer?""  If wages continue to stagnate, mass evictions, shit jobs, this continued ""back to normal but not,"" riots and assaults and increased divisions?  Well, it's all the fault of immigrants or millennials or zoomers or social media.  

I don't know if we're gonna get out of this, but if we do, it's gonna be a loooooooong time, or take a loooooooooot of death to get us there.

t3_lxpod5	CMV: Politicians need to have a stronger emphasis on data and science and a smaller emphasis on feelings/emotions to drive policy and lawmaking.	"I think this is systemic on both sides of the aisle. Republicans will  fear-mongering to drive their policies and agendas, with very little basis in data. Democrats also focus heavily on pushing a ""fairness and equality"" narrative that drives their policies and agendas, oftentimes ignoring science and data that suggests better alternatives.  

Why the flying fork are we not just using data and science to drive a lot of economic/policy decisions? Like, let's freaking invest $10 billion a year in just researching policy initiatives and then using the results to drive better decision making. It makes absolutely no sense to me. And yes, both sides of the aisle are guilty of this, though maybe one more than the other. Am I missing something here?

t3_6nhtpl	CMV: Anti-Globalization is the largest threat to global security and prosperity.	"Globalization has lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty, created immense wealth that has been unprecedented in the history of man, and all of this is still with much work left to do! 
The global poor nations clamor for free trade agreements and generally have positive views on free trade, as per surveys published by the economist. Those who hate globalization and free trade the most are ironically those who have benefited from them the most, countries like France and America. A wage of $.50 an hour can seem barbaric to us, but can be an absolute god send for a woman who has spent her whole live living in a rural village on less than a dollar a day. 

There is also the threat anti-globalization poses to world peace. There hasn't been any greater boon to global security and peace than free exchange. Countries who do much trade with one another are very unlikely to go to war with each other, largely why I believe that China and the US still somewhat friendly relations. The more connected the world is, the less interest any one state or group has in attacking any other nation. 

An attempt to pare back globalization is really an attempt to destroy decades work of progress toward a peaceful and prosperous world.

t3_55q710	CMV:Learning about Politics (and most world issues) is an unproductive pursuit with few tangible benefits.	"I am someone that spends a pretty significant amount of time trying to learn about the world I live in. I tend to read a lot, and would consider myself to be pretty well versed about issues in the world compared to the average citizen. In some ways, I do feel that curiosity to learn has helped me in my studies and so on. (Also OOPS I didn't mean to capitalize politics in the title)

That being said, it is probably less productive than almost any other hobby, because I believe there is a similar effect to the 'tragedy of commons.' No matter how much I learn, my vote counts the exact same as the guy who forms his worldview from the other dudes at the barbershop. Even on the Facebook posts from respected publications (like the Economist), the comments are filled with nonsense. 

The same could even be said about climate change. I accept it, and the potential effects in the future terrify me. In fact, I would say that it hurts my life to accept climate change. Some people I know basically think that it's a myth perpetuated by greedy politicians looking to raise carbon taxes, and they can happily pollute with no second thought.

Essentially, I believe 1) Ignorance is bliss 2) Being knowledgeable about politics and other issues is mostly pointless because I have the same tiny amount of power as the people who are completely illiterate on these matters.

t3_m364m7	CMV: Apex predators are not necessary for an ecosystem’s survival	"When someone gets attacked by a bear, shark, mountain lion, etc. scientists are quick to point out that these animals a necessary for the survival of the ecosystem. The reasoning is that they help keep the population of non-predators healthy and at a reasonable level.

Terminology:

By ecosystem survival, I don’t mean it will look or function the same, but that it will not trigger an ecosystem collapse.

And I’m using Wikipedia’s definition of ecosystem collapse: “a situation where an ecosystem suffers a drastic, possibly permanent, reduction in carrying capacity for all organisms, often resulting in mass extinction.”

Reasoning:

1) Humans or other animals could take over that responsibility. If there were no sharks, other animals like dolphins, predatory fish, etc. would simply take over the title of apex predator and keep those populations in check. Or, humans could expand fishing rights or methods to harvest more fish.

2) New Zealand has a goal to become predator free by 2050, so they don’t seem worried about an ecosystem collapse.

3) Apex predator populations weed out the sick and weak and keep their populations in check through competition for food and mates. Presumably, non-predator species would do the same over time if predatory pressures were removed.

4) Apex predators like the Saber Tooth Tiger have gone extinct without any noticeable ecosystem collapse.

5) The studies I’ve seen around decreasing predation highlight short term effects, like a reduction in grassland, but don’t seem to study the effects after multiple generations or the effects of human intervention.

Sure, ecosystems would change, some significantly, but I don’t see how ecosystems would collapse if dominant apex predators went extinct."	1	
t3_6yuj39	CMV: Recycling isn't that important.	"Mostly I'm looking for clarification of the cost/benefit analysis of in-home recycling. I have a couple sub-questions to which I'd love to get good answers.

(1) What's so bad about putting paper and plastic into a landfill? People often point out that materials won't decompose for thousands of years if they're in a landfill, but is there any actual downside to that?

(2) My impression is that managing emissions of greenhouse gasses is the most pressing modern environmental issue. Doesn't the recycling process add damaging emissions? My intuition is that it must.

(3) I've heard that tree farms are very good for the environment as young, fast-growing trees are excellent carbon-fixers. Does recycling paper reduce demand for farmed paper and, by extension, harm the environment?

t3_3c4tl0	CMV: I believe it's more ethical to eat meat and not consume dairy products than vice versa	"It's my impression that many lacto-ovo vegetarians have chosen their diet partially or solely out of ethical reasons. 
I think vegetarianism is good for many reasons, but I argue that, from an ethical point of view, it can be less unethical to eat meat than eating diary products.

My reasoning is as follows:

I believe that it's possible to raise farm animals in a way where they live a good, safe life and when it's time to slaughter them it's also possible to do this in a way where the stress and pain is minimal or maybe even non existent (this is also the case with game). This is of course not how the majority of farm animals are kept, but my point is that it's possible as a consumer to get ""ethically"" (or rather less non-ethically) sourced meat. 

On the other hand I don't think it's possible to find ethically dairy products (unless you have your own cows, let the calf stay with the mother and only take the excess milk that the calf doesn't drink).
Cows doesn't naturally produce milk all the time, so they are routinely impregnated and when the calf is born it is taken away from the mother after a short while. It's stressfull for the cow to be forced to produce milk all the time and it's stressfull for the cow and calf to be separated from each other.

So to summarise: I think that it's possible to purchase meat where the animals have been subjected to a minimal amount of suffering whereas it's not (realistically) possible to get hold of dairy products that has been produced without a great deal of suffering from the cows and calves.

Change my view!


A better title would be ""CMV: It generally causes animals more suffering, to eat high welfare/organic meat and not consume high welfare/organic dairy products than vice versa""

t3_52y8pn	"CMV: ""Lean Six Sigma"" is damaging to long term potential, creating points of failure and reducing tribal knowledge."	"""Lean"" and Six Sigma (kind of like saying facial tissue and Kleenex) are concepts applied chiefly to industrial engineering, manufacturing, and IT. They emphasize identifying what matters and eliminating everything else.

Tribal knowledge is often hand waved. ""It's meaningless compared to our data"" or ""well just write it down!"" This is dangerous. When oil crashed, a lot of businesses tied to oil (milk commodity prices are also driving significant market changes) had to adapt. Data is meaningless without context, and in the new context where commodity prices changed beyond a threshold, and the value equation changed. An easy example is that the cost to extract oil from some fields went below the market price and they closed. A harder example is that vendors sErving oil extraction as an industry will continue to be relevant, but market share, it was plain to see, would shift enormously away from certain operations. 

This is where the lean model Achilles Heel shows itself. By investigating very granular, high quality data, there is no reason to Make a change to be prepared for the new market. The slowest to adapt will miss out on market share in a big way, since everyone is scrambling to balance the books. The stakes are high.

Tribal knowledge (specifically in a business sense) is what you have when you have stayed in an industry long enough to have a reliable gut feeling based on many shreds of information gleaned over a deep depth and broad breadth of experience applied to a new problem. It is most valuable when the new problem is radically different, and I would argue that this is also the most important stage of product development to get right. Like Apple's iPod. Web based news. MySpace got it wrong by not adapting or answering the demand the best way, Facebook mostly nailed it, and Google Plus's biggest hurdle is being late to the party.

Data can't replace tribal knowledge, and it's impossible for the tribe's elders to simply turn tribal knowledge into data because the relationships as they are defined in today's paradigm are wildly different after a paradigm shift. It takes a sum total knowledge in one decision making body, applied properly knowing the old context, the reason for the old context, the new context, and the specific nature of the new freedoms ore restrictions, to make the very best decision.

Regrading creating points of failure, sometimes you might not get rid of all your old hats, but burn a few and hire some younger cheaper staff to pick up the slack, but then those guys retire or get hit by the proverbial bus and you don't know there's a problem until very late. 

By concentrating tribal knowledge, particularly in the old, particularly down to one or two people in a department, particularly when there is a culture gap between young grunts and the good old boys, one loss or a little interpersonal garbage can grind it all to a halt. Contrast apprentice/journeyman/master mentorship style where one or two people not getting along or disappearing is less catastrophic overall. As the old are falling out the top and the new are piking up at the bottom, as experience is widely distributed and shared, and little wisdoms accrued, there is a redundancy of excellent decision making powers, and that redundancy is eminently valuable.

Much like in teaching, excellence in these areas cannot be measured extrinsically. Much like in teaching, there is a data and measurement fetish that is blind to its own drawbacks, that measures one thing but says it's measuring something else. 

Change my view. I'm hoping that your responses will dissuade me from my doom and gloom and provide a road map to corporate success.

t3_7jbruo	CMV: The heat death of the universe has no impact whatsoever on my life	"First, as a disclaimer, I’m talking about emotional or spiritual impact, not educational impact. I’m not saying astrophysicists shouldn’t study the future of the universe or that learning about heat death is useless. I just think it’s useless as a source of emotional meaning (or lack of meaning) about my life or the lives of those I care about. This seems obvious to me but I’ve noticed that a lot of people on the Internet seem depressed or discouraged by the idea that astrophysicists think that the universe will eventually “die” (stop exchanging energy, making life as we know it impossible). I don’t understand this feeling. If I avoid dying from a car crash and die of old age, I’ll live at most about 100 years. Anything that happens after that is basically meaningless to me, because I won’t be able to experience it. But of course that’s not the whole story: what if humans invent a way to live forever? We’re nowhere close to doing that, but humans are creative and hate death, so for the sake of argument, let’s say I never die of old age. Now how long will I have to live for the universe’s heat death to be a personal concern for me? Written history is 5,000 years old, and my natural life span is only 2% of that amount of time. In 5,000 years, entire ways of life, including language, religion, and the concept of civilization have changed so much they have become completely unrecognizeable. If the next 5,000 years are anything like the last 5,000 years, then there is no way my hypothetical immortal self will emerge from that much time with the same worldview, without becoming a completely different person with a completely different idea of what matters in life. But again, the future is unknown, and if people were immortal maybe human culture wouldn’t change as fast, so for the sake of argument, let’s say my personality doesn’t change, and the things I worry about today are the same things I worry about in 5,000 years. In 5 billion years our sun is going to run out of hydrogen fuel and stop producing light and heat, possibly destroying the Earth and definitely ruining it for life. Written history is 0.0001% of the amount of time our planet has before this happens. Keep in mind that 5 billion years is longer than we know life to have existed up to now. In 5 billion years all life that we know of will die. No more humans, no more plants, no more bacteria, with the possible exception of geothermic vent life that uses energy from Earth’s core rather than the sun. Kind of hard to care about the heat death of the universe when you and everything else on the planet is dead. But what if we escape this death by travelling to live on another planet or by living off the geothermal vents? What if immortal Me is still alive at this time and avoids dying from this? Now I have until the last stars go out. According to the Wikipedia article, “Future of an expanding universe”, this will happen in 100 trillion years. The amount of time before our sun dies is 0.005% of that time. If humans escaped to a new star system, and then another one when that star system died, and then another one, we would have this long before no new stars could form and the universe would go dark. And even this is not the heat death of the universe, because there would still be some things in the universe that emit energy, like radioactive matter or black holes with Hawking radiation. The last black holes will evaporate in 10^100 years, and I don’t want to write out this percentage because there would be so many 0’s it would just look silly. That’s how long I would have to live for heat death to impact me. If you are looking at this problem logically, I think you’ll have to agree with me that the chances of being personally affected by the heat death of the universe are so small they are indistinguishable from zero. But we’re emotional beings, so what if you look at the problem with your emotions? Think about the thousand-year time scale, where hundreds of generations of people live and die and are forgotten by history; shouldn’t you be more worried about that than heat death? Think about the 5-billion-year lifespan of our solar system, and the 100-trillion-year maximum lifespan of our galaxy. Those all seem like way more emotional problems than heat death to me. I feel like there are so many things in the future that are way scarier than heat death, and I’m confused why people let heat death bother them. And finally, what if you look at this problem not just scientifically, but spiritually? What if you believe that after you die, your spirit or your soul will keep living and you will still somehow have a part to play in what happens to the universe on long time scales? If you believe in spirits, then you already believe in a plane of existence that physics doesn’t understand, so I feel like heat death has become a lot less of a problem for you. If spirits can exist even after their physical bodies are gone, why can’t they exist after the universe is gone? If you believe in a god who has always existed, then presumably He will keep existing after heat death, even if he doesn’t choose to stop heat death from happening. Plus, a lot of religious worldviews have some pretty scary futures that, again, are way scarier than heat death, like an imminent destruction of society or an eternity of burning in hell. In conclusion, please explain to me why heat death makes people anxious because it’s so vague and long-term that I don’t understand why anyone, skeptic, humanist, spiritual, or traditionally religious, could be afraid of it.

t3_3zhv8l	CMV: Regulation of money in politics is regulation of speech.	"One of the main complaints against the election system today is the presence of enormous amounts of (often corporate) money in the political process. I agree with this; I think that it is easily to demonstrate the power that money holds in our (the US) election system, and that in order to maintain a fair democracy we must change it. However, I think that **regulation of money in politics is regulation of speech**. (note: I don't think that this automatically makes it a bad thing. I think we definitely need money out of politics. I am simply arguing that doing so via government regulation would mean regulating free speech. In addition, I am not making an argument grounded in the First Amendment but on the principle of free speech in general.) This is for a few main reasons:

First, money is necessary to facilitate speech. I can write all the slogans or speeches I want; if I don't have money to print leaflets or organize forums, my speech doesn't matter. This is less important in the age of the internet but still relevant. Therefore we conclude that money is speech on small scales. This can be extended to larger scales: if I can protest as one person with some leaflets, why can I not get 2 or 20 people to do so? And why can I not form a nationwide protest with 20000 people, if I can get enough support? This requires money; significantly more money per person, in fact, than if it was just me. This is because of the costs of organizing and running large protests. Therefore this money must be protected.

Next, what if, for some reason, I am unable to volunteer? Let's say I have no time to volunteer, and the only way I can support a cause is to donate. Should my right to support a cause be regulated because I am a busy person? 

And if I am able to donate, why can a corporation not donate? For instance, let's say I think that we should kick everyone who is doesn't like me out of the country (I do not, obviously, but just for the sake of argument) for my own self-interest. It is clear that advocating for this this is protected speech and that I have a right to protest, and if I can recruit enough people, to form an organization. So why can corporations not do the same? People should not lose rights because they join together in groups.

Everything in this argument which does not explicitly apply to political campaigns can be extended to them. If I can donate to a cause, the government has no right to regulate the cause I choose to support.

t3_3qartd	"CMV: If we discover a planet that is amenable to terraforming, and does not already hold intelligent life, we should terraform it."	"I got into a discussion with a friend of mine -- I made the comment that even if Humanity never leaves the Solar System, we'd eventually end up on some other planets and/or moons, terraforming Venus and Mars being likely candidates (future magical terraforming technology aside -- that is not the point of this CMV, this CMV is with the assumption that it is possible to terraform a planet).

He then suggested a line of thinking that seemed very odd to me -- whether we had ""a right to terraform"" and started speaking of the ethics involved in the case of life forms that we couldn't understand yet or didn't know existed. He tossed out the idea of ""electromagnetic life forms"" and such, which seemed immediately preposterous, or that we couldn't know some life didn't exist on a planet, in the form of bacteria or other single-celled organisms.

I think that's patently ludicrous. If we encounter another planet that is reasonably hospitable to us and amenable to terraforming, and there is no intelligent life on the planet, then we should terraform it. Bacteria don't have rights. Electromagnetic life forms sound like Star Trek fiction. I would even go so far as to say multi-cellular vegetative life is probably irrelevant.

Given the scarcity of planets that we can reasonably reach, even if we did discover some rudimentary life, waiting millions of years for that plant or bacteria to turn into an intelligent species, if it is even possible for more than single-celled life to exist on that planet without our intervention, seems incredibly wasteful.

The only valid argument against terraforming is that intelligent life already exists on a planet. In the same way that we don't concern ourselves with the feelings of a potato, or of a bacterial cell, we shouldn't suddenly give greater weight to those simply because they exist on another planet. 

Any intelligent life that is more advanced than us can make itself known to us and has nothing to fear from us, and any intelligent life that is near our level or below would be immediately obvious to our observers and should be left alone (or perhaps contacted diplomatically if they are capable of it).

So, convince me that terraforming is an ethical quandry, because I just don't see it.



Most replies are focusing on the idea of a super-advanced alien civilization classifying humanity akin to ants or bacteria, or else setting arbitrary definitions on intelligence, and how with these scenarios humanity would be destroyed, so we shouldn't destroy *any* life even if it looks unintelligent, and I think I've addressed that as well as I can already.

t3_7ywf2x	CMV: I Should Not Worry About Using Disposable Goods	"I hold the view that I should not worry very much about my use of plastic products such as water bottles, plastic cups/utensils, coffee pods, diapers, shopping bags etc. I hold this few even though recycling may (https://alumni.stanford.edu/get/page/magazine/article/?article_id=47701) or may not (https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2017/07/plastic-produced-recycling-waste-ocean-trash-debris-environment/) be very efficient. Honestly, I believe I would hold this view even if recycling of ""everyday plastics"" wasn't happening. 

Seeing articles like this: (https://gizmodo.com/stop-buying-coffee-pods-1703073159) in which the author seems to make the case I should avoid coffee pods because, among other reasons, they are ""probably ending up in a landfill somewhere"", are very unconvincing to me, at least partially, because what I've learned so far about modern landfill based waste management makes it seem totally fine/acceptable.

Additionally, it is accepted that disposable goods provide the consumer tangible convenience. From a philosophical standpoint, I believe it should be a priority for me to to maximize joy and reduce discomfort. Most assuredly, for me at least, switching to non-disposable options would go against that priority. And while this is not critical to this view, I think it is fair that it be considered IF the benefits/costs are marginal and this point would tilt the scales one way or another. To be clear, in this case: **(TLDR) I think between recycling and modern landfill management reducing environmental cost, the convenience benefit of disposable goods outweighs the lesser benefits of using durable goods.**

To change my view, I would be looking for evidence/strong logical case that use of disposable goods at an individual level is not in the best interest of that individual.

I will not be convinced by arguments that solely lean on the fact some materials take ""XXX years to degrade"". If the science/math shows we will be swimming in garbage by year 3000, I'll accept it. But just the fact that ""using something for a few minutes, then it is around forever 'feels' bad"" is unconvincing.
I will also not be convinced by arguments that are taken to an absurd timescale. I do not care about humans in the years 5000+. If they don't have the technology to clean up the earth in efficient ways by then, they can just leave. 

Other than that, Reddit, change my view!"	1	
t3_4qmu6w	CMV: The Harms of Genetically Modified Foods Outweigh the Benefits.	"I think all people should keep the Precautionary Principle foremost in their minds. This principle states that if something could do damage to humans or the environment, the burden of proof lies with those that support the policy to prove it cannot cause harm.

1) GMOs are Devastating to local Environments

A.	GMO Use Will Create Superbugs

Recently, farmers found rootworms, a serious pest, with resistance to Bt corn. According to the National Academy of Sciences, the rootworm was resistant to one third of the varieties of Bt corn. And, scientists have found resistance to a second variety this indicates that developing resistance to one variety increases the chance of developing resistance to a second. GMO crops only serve as a short-term solution.

B.	GMO Use Will Create Superweeds

According to Food and Water Watch, the use of GMO Roundup Ready soy, corn and cotton have increased tenfold between 1996 and 2012. Stratus, an agricultural research company, surveyed thousands of US farmers between 2010 and 2012. They found nearly half of those surveyed have Roundup resistant weeds growing in their fields with one quarter reporting at least two different species. Even more disconcerting, is that the rate of resistant weeds grew by 51% in 2012.

C.	GMO Use Can Destroy Biodiversity
				
According to John Krebs, “In the past 20 years, ten million [...]individuals of ten species of farmland birds have disappeared.” These birds have vanished because the insects that they prey upon have been exterminated. This continues to affect the food chain, with exponential consequences upon the rest of the local environment. GMO farms systematically eliminate natural species. This coupled with the Pandora’s box that comes with introducing genetically superior specimens to an environment is enough to warrant a dramatic reduction in GM technology. 

D.	The aforementioned environmental destruction disproportionately affects developing nations. 

Native American Nations have cultures and religious traditions tied to their food. As sovereign states, Native communities across America have issued bans on GE organisms within their borders. As GMO corn easily pollinates across invisible nation-state lines, GMOs represent not only a legal challenge to the sovereignty of these nations, stripping their power, but also propagate a cultural siege against Native people and their beliefs.

Of the farmers that grew GM Crops, “90% were poor farmers in developing countries.” (ISAAA) The harmful effects of GMOs predominantly affect developing nations and those citizens have neither the laws nor the litigation power to defend themselves. According to Al Jazeera, in India over 300,000 farmers have committed suicide to escape the huge burden of debt accrued from buying GMO seed. GMOs are tools of social discrimination and class subjugation.  

We, the general public, and the international community, must recognize the harmful societal effects of GMOs. It is unjustifiable to embrace technology that is used to discriminate, commit human rights offences, and infringe on religious and sovereign rights. 

2) GMOs have not had sufficient long-term studies to justify their wide use. 

A)	Allergenicity

A food allergy occurs when the body has an immune response to a protein in food. A study by Dr. Verma of the University of Singapore, found the insertion of new genes into plants guarantees the plant creates new proteins with its newfound genetic codes. With each new protein, the possibility of an allergic reaction is increased. GMOs turn eating into a game of Russian roulette, with no way of knowing if you will have an undiscovered allergy to the food you are eating. 

B)	Long-Term Effects

According to a study executed by the University of Caen, rats fed a diet containing NK603 - a seed with FDA approved GE resistance to Roundup - died earlier than those on a standard diet. The animals on the GM diet suffered mammary tumours, as well as severe liver and kidney damage. Premature mortality was also 3x as high in the GM fed group.**

	Despite optimism toward the benefits of GMOs, the simple truth remains: We’ve only been living with GMOs for around 20 years; slightly longer than the members of this discussion have been alive. There simply has not been enough time to determine the actual effects of GMOs. It is irresponsible to dive in head first blindly.  

**Many have pointed out that the paper was withdrawn when there were complaints about the conclusions drawn and the evidence used. However, since, a second peer-reviewed journal has republished the results. They journal "" concluded there had been no fraud nor misrepresentation"". http://www.nature.com/news/paper-claiming-gm-link-with-tumours-republished-1.15463

**For those thinking I am unwilling to change my mind and /u/factbasedorGTFO :**

 I'm not clinging to Serilini, I have admitted his experimental design was flawed and conceded a lot of points to posters. I actually was on the fence and wrote up all the arguments that were most convincing to me. I nearly believe in them, and I believe that GM has enormous potential but right now I am having trouble seeing it. I'll post my thoughts on the other side below: 

I already like these views, so you could probably win me over if you explained them better than I could to myself.

Because we are considering whether or not the benefits of GMO technology outweigh the harms, you should be evaluating this discussion with a cost-benefit analysis through a utilitarian framework. One must prove that they are bringing the greatest amount of good to the greatest number of people and I contend that GMOs can do that.

1) Genetically modified foods have pushed humanity beyond the carrying capacity of the Earth.

A) Malthusianism in the Status Quo

In 1779, Thomas Malthus doomed humanity to constantly border on famine. Malthus said, “The power of population is so superior to the power of the earth to produce for man, that premature death must [...] visit the human race.” The premise is simple. Population multiplies exponentially, while food multiplies linearly. According to Dr. Chen of the University of Singapore, “Recent statistics show that the acreage planted on a global basis is no longer increasing [...]. If no new production technologies are developed and adopted, the food supply curve will no longer shift.”

B) Famine is imminent sans substantial increases in crop yields through GE production.

Without GM crops, humanity faces starvation. Those affected won’t be people like us, living in developed nations, but rather the people on the periphery and semi-periphery of the world economy. According to Dr. Wallace from the University of Toronto, the population is set to increase by 65% by 2050. Of the additional 3.7 billion people, approximately 97% of them will live in developing nations. He says, “the additional food required to feed future generations will put enormous pressure on [...] resources.” This is why Dr. Chen concludes that “in response to the question: ""Do humans need GMOs?"", all results [...] indicate that they do.”

2) GM crops help stymie climate change and end harmful environmental practices.

	A) Biodiversity and Deforestation

A study by UKaid states “Agriculture is the direct driver of 70% of deforestation worldwide.” If the 328 million tons of additional food [...] produced by GM crops from 1996 to 2011 had not been produced, an additional 108.7 million hectares of conventional crops would have been required to produce the same tonnage. The use of GM foods had an opportunity gain of 268 million acres and the land required would be equivalent to deforesting the area of the UK, Spain, and Germany-- combined.. 80% of terrestrial species live in rainforest habitat and deforestation for farming would be nothing short of an environmental disaster. Genetically Modified crops are a land-saving technology, capable of higher productivity, and can thereby help preclude deforestation and protect biodiversity. 
 
	B) GM Crops decrease nitrogen pollution

Nitrous oxide has 300 times more of an impact on the environment than CO2. Farming accounts for 75% of NO2 released. GM Crops that are endowed with a gene from corn increases the nitrogen absorption of the crop by 30%, when compared to non-GM crops and they require just 1/10th the nitrogen fertilizer of other crops. According to the National Academy of Sciences, genetic modification greatly decreases the negative impacts of nitrogen in our environment which includes large scale freshwater contamination and the emission of a potent greenhouse gas.

3) Genetically Modified Organisms have exceeded the scientific standard for safety.

A)	Meta-analysis proves their safety. 

Meta-studies are the gold standard within the scientific community and wield far greater statistical power. A publicly funded meta-analysis of GMOs conducted by Dr. Klumper and Dr. Qaim of the Department of Agricultural Economics found, “GM technology adoption has reduced chemical pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yields by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68%”. A different meta analysis published in the Critical Review of Biotechnology included 1700 studies and took a year to compile. This study concluded that “the  scientific research conducted  has  not  detected  any  significant  hazard directly connected with the use of GM crops.” And ruled health concerns to be “categorically false”.

t3_hlir8e	"CMV: It was a mistake for The Conversation to ban climate change denialism on their platform, because it backfired."	"A few days ago, I had a long debate with a climate change denier on r/climatechange. [He claimed](https://np.reddit.com/r/climatechange/comments/hjop9s/how_can_we_manufacture_consent_for_climate_action/fwohqwv?context=100) that media (especially with [*The Conversation* banning climate change denial](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/science/academic-website-the-conversation-bans-climate-change-sceptics-locks-dissenter-accounts/news-story/0190784f1019fc4ba5d962a0cc562c45)), the UN, businesses and academia have ganged up to indoctrinate us into believing in the ""climate change scare"". I also admit that it was a mistake on my part to use the words ""manufacture consent"" in my post title.

This CMV post is **not** a discussion on whether or not you believe that climate change is a hoax. This CMV post is also **not** a discussion on the accuracy or validity of research into climate change.

This CMV **is** about the backfiring of *The Conversation*'s decision to ban climate change denialism on their platform. For example:

* If you believe that climate change is real and every bit as bad as *The Conversation* says it is, then banning climate change denial backfired because instead of preventing misinformation, it is instead inflaming climate change deniers by giving them a reason to complain of persecution.
* If you believe that climate change is a hoax (or is completely natural) and that *The Conversation* is stomping on your right to freedom of thought by banning banning climate change denial, then their action backfired because it helps strengthen your argument that academia and media are conspiring against you.

Finally, I am not a climate change denier myself. However, I now think that perhaps banning climate change denial on a media outlet will achieve the exact opposite of its goal."	1	
t3_7onje8	"CMV: While I think that humanity has a pretty good chance of becoming established in space, Mars will never be terraformed and will likely never have more than a few thousand people permanently living on it."	"I don't think this is because we won't ever get established in space. I actually think it's pretty likely we'll have a few million people living in space within one or two hundred years, and in five hundred there may be a dozen people in space for every person on Earth, with that ratio only increasing with time. 

However, pretty much all of them would be in free-floating habitats made using materials from asteroids, airless moons (from tiny captured asteroids to the Moon and Ganymede, I'll explain why being airless is important later), and maybe even Mercury. 

Mars just doesn't have all that much going for it, and teraforming it would be really hard. There is enough CO2 in the ice caps to make a breathable atmosphere if the carbon was removed, but oxygen is only 21% of the atmosphere. The remainder is almost all nitrogen, and while animals don't need gaseous nitrogen to survive, it is really important for plants. Mars does not have nearly enough nitrogen anywhere on or inside the planet to increase the nitrogen levels of the atmosphere for nitrogen fixation to take place.

Theoretically, you could bring in nitrogen from somewhere else. There is a ton of nitrogen in the atmospheres of Venus, Saturn's moon Titan, Kuiper belt objects, and comets. If you were willing to go really far, there are millions of times the needed amount in the gas giants in the Sun. Earth also has a lot of nitrogen, but you'd have to remove a lot of the atmosphere to get enough nitrogen, so that's not really a viable option. The problem is just how much nitrogen you would need. You could dump a billion tons of nitrogen a day onto Mars, and it would still take tens of thousands of years to get enough nitrogen there. 

However, I don't think the lack of nitrogen is an impossible challenge. There are quite a few technologies which make moving large amounts of material between planets very easy. [Launch loops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Launch_loop) and [orbital rings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbital_ring#Birch's_model) with attached [mass drivers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass_driver) allow for very low launch costs to orbit or between planets/moons (dollars or cents per kilogram), and these could be easily reduced by launching from places with lower gravity, fusion, and automated manufacturing. Launching from airless moons, even large ones, or the planet Mercury (which has no atmosphere), also reduces costs, as you don't need things such as orbital rings to hold the mass drivers above the atmosphere. However, the atmosphere of Mars is too thick for the launch mechanism to be placed directly on the surface, making the movement of materials from the surface not that much easier than from Earth with these technologies. You would also have to remove a lot of atmosphere, including a lot of nitrogen, from Venus if you wanted to terraform it, and the nitrogen could easily be sent to Mars. The real problem is the low gravity of Mars.

The gravity on the surface of Mars is about 38% of Earth's. We don't know if human reproduction is even possible in that low gravity, and if it is, the children would most likely be too weak to visit Earth or rotating habitats with Earth gravity. Of the other planets, Mercury has about the same gravity as Mars, Jupiter's is far too high, and Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune have about the same gravity but, being made mostly of gas, are not viable for terraforming (but not necessarily colonization). 

Venus, while its atmosphere is far too thick, and its rotation is far too long, is the only rocky planet with a gravity near Earth's. With orbital rings, you likely could remove most of the atmosphere (and possibly even make a profit by selling it to habitats in need of carbon and nitrogen), and fusion allows extremely efficient rocket engines that likely could spin the planet up to a more reasonable day/night cycle in a few centuries, provided they were attached to an orbital ring attached to the surface of the planet. Leaving a bit of nitrogen and CO2 (to be converted into O2 and carbon), then importing a bunch of water for oceans after all of this could give you a perfectly habitable planet.

We still haven't asked why anyone would do this instead of just building more habitats though. There really isn't a reason to. Unlike asteroids, which have a lot of easily accessible precious metals to start mining, and a much smaller gravity well than Earth to get materials to build habitats from, Mars doesn't have anything the Earth does not. Even with present materials like steel and Kevlar, you could easily build a free-floating habitat in space dozens of miles wide and hundreds of miles long. It's a lot easier to build a habitat than terraforming a planet too. It might take a heavily automated company with a few thousand employees a few years to turn a ten kilometer-wide asteroid or a similar amount of material shot off of the surface of a moon into a habitat able to hold millions or tens of millions of people, but it would take many governments working together centuries to terraform even Venus, and it's pretty much physically impossible to get any of the others to a truly Earth-like condition.

The habitats wouldn't be cramped hellholes either. If you were using sunlight for energy and to grow crops, you could really only use one level to grow food, and even in perfect conditions you still need far more space to grow crops than for living space, so I could see 10% of the upper level being given over to houses, parks, ect, as it would not reduce the number of people that could live in the habitat by much.

With fusion, you could have multiple levels, but you just can't light more than a few dozen floors before the waste heat would increase the average temperature inside the habitat too much for people to live there.  For those, the innermost level would be the level where most people lived, with the remaining levels being devoted to industry and agriculture. With larger habitats, it may be possible to have two or three levels spaced a few miles apart, possibly with a simulated sky - perhaps just a very low-resolution monitor on the bottom of the floor above them (the pixels can be meters wide to lower costs, as the people viewing them will be kilometers away 99.9% of the time). Some may even turn over a level to nature preserves - you can easily get thousands of square miles with habitats dozens of miles wide and hundreds of miles long, and it won't really matter too much to the animals as long as they have a few feet of dirt for burrowing animals and roots and a few miles of air for birds. Gravity would be slightly different between the levels, but most animals and people would be fine if the gravity changed by a few percent - the levels are just a few miles apart while the habitat is dozens or hundreds of miles across, depending on what materials they have to work with.

So what would happen to Mars and the other planets if they are never colonized? Most likely, they would eventually all be turned into habitats (or fuel, for the gas giants). This actually wouldn't require the same amount of cooperation as terraforming a planet, as crazy as it sounds. As long as the population grows, more habitats will be built from those easy sources of materials I talked about earlier. However, eventually, all of these sources will be depleted. There are only so many asteroids in the solar system, and only so much rock and metal in Mercury and the Moon. After these, Mars is the easiest place to send materials from the surface to orbit from. With a population possibly tens of billions of times what we have now, demand for raw materials would be gigantic. You could easily have millions of companies exporting trillions of tons of raw materials off of the surface each, and the amount of material being brought to space each year would only be a few tons per person in the Solar System, with that being the main source of raw materials in use. 

Within a few hundred thousand years, the only planet left in the Solar System may well be just the Earth (I think governments would take action to prevent its disassembly, as we will still probably care a lot about it), with not a single organization taking apart a planet by itself, just many millions of groups trying to meet the demands of quadrillions of people. Eventually, even the Sun may be disassembled, its hydrogen and possibly helium used to fuel fusion reactors and the few percent of heavier elements used to build habitats. This will likely happen in other colonized systems, as we will have even less of an attachment to random exoplanets and stars than we do to our own Solar System.

t3_55n6g8	"CMV: As long as there's no guaranteed way to protect global harvests against natural disasters, we should keep population expansion at a minimum."	"Background: the cause of the Arab Spring: There wasn't enough 
food, so food prices went up to an amount people could not afford. We've been told this again and again. But why was there not enough food?

http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-change-and-rising-food-prices-heightened-arab-spring/


This can happen again. Maybe it already has and we'll find out in a few months, I don't know if there's data on this.

So, prices for food go up and people will always need food. Food is a priority. So they'll spend more of their available money on the food. This drives them into poverty.

Those already poor have less buying power and therefore will be able to buy less anyway. People grow desperate and riot. Or even go to war.

War destroys the economic prowess of a region. Poverty increases. More people get desperate. Etc...

I wonder if the effect would have been less if there had been fewer people for it to affect. But how to attain this without putting down a mandatory ""amount of children"" law, as China once did. Which I'm told lead to horrible things.

I feel that, as long as there is no solution to guarantee the global harvests, that overpopulation will only ever cause more poverty and by extension: more war. More people means you need more food and since the amount of food isn't high enough, this will lead to riots and wars.

But if you tell people that 8 children is perhaps a bit much and maybe 2 is a better idea, you're infringing on their freedoms.

I say: as things are now, those freedoms are going to ruin the earth. Because we don't have a solution to secure our harvests against natural disasters. Meaning we can't guarantee enough food for everyone.

Having more population means more food needs to be produced and bought to support that population, meaning the reserves go down for everyone, meaning prices go up and poverty increases.

The ideal solution, of course, would be: plant more crops and get more harvest. But that doesn't work if some natural disaster comes along and wipes it all out. We can't just sit back and assume this will not happen again, just because we don't want it to happen.

And I don't think revolting against any government is going to change things either. The only thing that needs changing is how we secure harvests. There needs to be proper protection to ensure that harvests can no longer be destroyed by natural disasters. Both in terms of protecting the climate and how the harvests are secured.

As long as these issues are not properly solved, we should put an effort into keeping the increase in population at a bare minimum, just enough to guarantee a future generation.

If someone has a better idea than that: I'm all ears. I'd prefer something better than what I just wrote out."	1

t3_4capvw	"CMV: American politics no longer cares about logic or reason, and as a young voter I have no reason to be optimistic about the future of my country."	"Emotion is everything in the modern political arena. Fear this, be angry at that, hate them, that's all it ever boils down to, and it's a plague that has infected both sides. I can't even decide which party to be more fed up with because they are both horrible.

On the one side you have democrats, the party that is SUPPOSED to be the pro science, pro rationality party. Yet, just to be opposed to republican interests it seems, they have chosen several horrendously misinformed platforms, making them blatant hypocrites.

Then you have republicans that don't even get far enough to say that they support logic because they blindly support faith based policy making. Sure, they aren't hypocrites, but they knowingly ignore facts simply because they don't care, and that's almost worse.

Below I want to list stances (with brief descriptions) on both sides that I feel one party is objectively wrong about, as well as issues I think they are both wrong about or that I don't know enough about to decide. I hope this will clarify why I'm so disenchanted with the current state of affairs.

Republicans:

Gay marriage- I hope I don't actually have to defend this point. we have a separation of church and state, your religious views are not grounds to restrict the rights of others.

Marijuana- we waste tons of money on the drug war in many ways. Marijuana is objectively less dangerous than other available legal substances, and the consensus on this is widespread.

Climate Change- It just is happening, and there is extremely well documented evidence that we are, at least to some degree, causing it.

Religion in general-this isnt a theocracy, we have several documents written by the founding fathers explicitly stating the country is not meant to be a christian nation, stop saying it is.

Democrats:

Gun Control- republican stances vary, but most support strengthening background checks and gun licensing, which have been shown capable of lowering gun violence up to 90%. This combined with the facts that you are many times more likely to be stabbed to death, drown in your bathtub, or fall down the stairs and die than you are to be killed with an assault rifle, makes a ban on assault rifles for the millions of people who obey the law illogical.

Energy- Climate change is real, but so is our energy demand. We cannot economically sustain this country exclusively on renewables, as nice as that would be. we could be doing better, so they aren't all wrong here, but Bernie's desire to run the country exclusively with renewable energy is wholly unrealistic.

Fracking/Nuclear- This is tied into the last point, but nuclear energy is cleaner and safer statistically than most renewables. Democrats, for whatever reason, like to make nuclear energy into a scary thing. it isn't, it's probably our best hope. Fracking is no longer exempt from the clean air and water acts, in not actually tied to burning faucets (those faucets burned before there was fracking because the methane bubbles up naturally in those areas) and the ""earthquakes"" is causes are barely even large enough to be detected by seismographs. Could there be more improvement? absolutely, but why completely right off huge supplies of a clean to burn fuel that can be recovered economically?

Economics- Republicans aren't always right on this either (cough bush war deficit) but experts and nobel prize winners alike overwhelmingly disagree with modern democratic platforms, specifically that of Bernie sanders. People like to say ""17 economists in this group are in favor of Bernie's plan!"" that group has 10k members. there are dissenting opinions, but there's about as much consensus among economists about this as there is among scientists about climate change.

Social Justice- There are issues that negatively affect women and minorities. however, not all white men are evil, white people do experience poverty, racism, and other social issues. Social problems in the modern world go every direction, some more than others. The left also seems like it wants to silence opposition, with violence if necessary, more than the right.

Both or don't know:

Muslims-no, they aren't all terrorist. Most don't even live in the middle east. Muslims can be perfectly nice normal people. Statistically, it also isn't an overwhelmingly peaceful religion and it is having hugely negative impacts on the western countries that it's becoming a part of. The right over-demonizes, the left over-sympathizes.

immigration-Don't really know enough to have an informed opinion

Wall Street- We don't need more regulations, we need to refund the SEC and actually give them enough resources to enforce the regulations we already have, the market is already very regulated. There are people who need to go to jail on Wall Street, but people who actually did something illegal, not normal people doing normal business up until the crash. 

Government funding- we spend too much for what we bring in. we can't tax the rich people enough to pay for it no matter what we do, and funding might need to come away from social security since it's a failing system, but our military is exorbitantly large and should also be one of the first places we look to cut spending.

I feel extremely confident in all of these stances, and even if you don't agree with every one, I'm willing to bet there is at least one or two issues on both sides you agree with me on. As such, why should I feel optimistic? no matter what side gets the presidency or congress, there are going to be laws passed that are not based on what is logically best for the public. Nobody cares anymore about actually trying to fix anything, they just care about what they feel, and they want to hurt the other side. Who the hell do I even vote for in this mess? Someone who ignores expert opinions and wants to limit individual freedom? Or Someone else who ignores expert opinions and wants to limit individual freedom? I just want gays to be happy, to smoke weed, to own guns, to be able to speak without being blamed for slavery, and to have faith that my elected officials actually care what is best for me, their constituent, and I don't think I will ever get that.

t3_2ytwub	"CMV: If we find extraterrestrial life, we will just treat it similarly to any other newly discovered animal species, and it will not unite and change humanity at all."	"I fear that it won't change that much at all. The discovery will be abstract, too foreign for people to understand its significance. People won't unite, they will just keep on going as usual, viewing it as a scientific curiosity. Looking at extraterrestrial life as being capable of changing and uniting humanity vastly underestimates our instincts. Instead of unity, we won't be fazed all too much by the news of alien life. It will probably not be intelligent, too. People can't identify with an organism akin to algae. It won't be able to change their views about the universe and our own planet, and it will certainly not change the people themselves.

Isn't thinking that the discovery of extraterrestrial life will fundamentally change the way we think about our planet and unite humanity just unrealistic and way too optimistic? Change my view.

t3_8cha6a	CMV: Total societal collapse is inevitable in my lifetime and no one is paying attention. (I am 21)	"Preamble: I am mostly writing this because I have been depressed about the direction of the world and want someone to convince me it will get better. This CMV comes from a video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-8uv4D7cOE on the collapse of the bronze age. It explains many potential factors within the video. It got me thinking: we have seen the Bronze Age collapse followed by centuries of dark ages, we have seen the Roman Empire collapse followed by an even longer dark age. Now in the present, we have the United States and their United Nations based on democratic principles and Capitalist economies. How long before the collapse? We have seen societies that relied on trade and globalization collapse because their systems could no longer support themselves following a big negative event. Then a domino effect leveled their whole civilization taking it back hundreds of years taking even longer to recover.

Argument: In this day and age we are threatened by ecological and economic problems the likes of which we have never seen. Global warming is the biggest issue facing humanity and nobody cares. In the next century or two we could see climate change destroy our ability to farm, over fishing could lead to the extinction of fish one of our biggest food resources, and the destruction of habitats has lead to the extinction or near extinction of hundreds of species. Economically we are not much better. Our governments are so intent on getting reelected and the voters are obsessed with football and the Kardashians to even pay attention to what is going on. We have no money to spend yet we are spending it. Social Security and Medicare alone will bankrupt the United States within the next 20 years. But rather than tackle this immense problem, our society has decided to argue about wars half a world away, argue about building a wall, argue about who can use a bathroom or who should get married, and a bunch or other stuff. Now I am not saying those things are trivial in and of themselves, but compared to total economic collapse they are. When the U.S. economy collapses so will the world's and we will be thrust back into a dark age of fighting for resources. CMV. "	1

I believe that everything exists and we evolved to this point, simply because we did. If our planet had a CO2 heavy atmosphere, we wouldn't be here. And that would be reality. But that didn't happen. There are seemingly infinite planets that didn't create life, but many probably did, and here we are.

All the UN really does is send peace keepers to 3rd world countries having civil war and put the problem on pause. they don't solve the problem, they just delay the inevitable. Instead of actually ending wars and creating peace, the UN just procrastinates until the problem figures out how to solve itself. sooner or later every country with UN peace keepers preventing fighting will eventually reach a conclusion. on top of that, the UN doesn't have much authority other than peer pressure. The only way the UN can get countries to do/not do things is by having a bunch of other countries tell them so. If they so choose, they can just ignore the UN. All the countries that peace keepers in any countries should pull out. it's a waste of time and money."	1	
t3_4orics	"CMV: Global policy and energy investments should focus on renewables instead of nuclear, hydrocarbons."	"This is a common topic that comes up in Reddit. I work in solar, and honestly don't see why we as a global society should focus on anything other than renewables, especially solar, wind, geothermal and tidal. 

I obviously have a huge bias, so I'm seeing if anyone has actual arguments and facts (not just the typical ""take a look at thorium!"" argument) for focusing on nuclear over renewables. I'm interested in knowing if my bias is blinding me from the truth or if my way of thinking is reasonable. 



My reasoning for focusing on renewables:

- Solar panels, wind turbines, etc are a technology, not a fuel source. The fuel source is unlimited, the technology is improving in efficiency and cost as they are further adopted. More adoption, more learning, cheaper cost, more adoption. This will eventually lead to a marginal cost of electricity. 

- A major part of manufacturing solar panels comes from energy costs. As energy prices fall, so will the technology to make them fall further. 

- Solar is scalable, distributed, easily manufactured. This means it is in the hands of anyone and therefore will constantly decrease in price since competition will always exist. Nuclear and hydrocarbons are centralized, which means they will always be in the hands of a few companies. Even if a major nuclear technology breakthrough happens, prices will fall as little as possible because the company that makes the breakthrough will look for profits. 

- There's presently no ""elagant"" solution for storage but mainly because we haven't needed it. Markets that need it (Hawaii, Australia) are already seeing storage installations grow exponentially. Storage is also a technology. The more you make, the cheaper it gets and the more you can deploy it. Storage will follow intermittency as it is required. The bigger the difference between mid-day electricity prices (which will approach 0 with more solar) and peak hour electricity prices, the more need and business opportunity for storage. The more we get into a ""problem"" because of a higher penetration of renewables, the more it'll be worth to solve. I believe solving this issue (which could just be a matter of scale as Tesla is betting on) is less of an issue than getting to thorium reactors or fusion."	1	
t3_6kov77	CMV: Human Evolution has Ceased	"My contention is that Human Evolution has ceased, or has significantly slowed, since the advent of human intelligence.  By Evolution, I refer to the currently taught Darwinian Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection.  Based on the authoritative definition of Evolution found in Wikipedia:

Evolution is change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.  The processes by which the changes occur, from one generation to another, are called evolutionary processes or mechanisms.[26] The four most widely recognised evolutionary processes are natural selection, genetic drift, mutation and gene migration due to genetic admixture.[26] Natural selection and genetic drift sort variation; mutation and gene migration create variation.

As taught, Evolution is a natural process in which accidental changes produce both positive and negative adaptations in a species.  Those that encourage survival remain and reproduce and those that do not die out.  As such it is a natural process occurring over long periods of time.
Since the advent of human intelligence, humanity has been selectively breeding both itself, the animals it eats and domesticates, and the plants that it harvests and eats.  Thus, conducting a form of directed Genetic Engineering through natural processes (a form of GMO).  Changes to these human, animal and plant species can thus be thought of in terms of Intelligent Design rather than Evolution.  The term Human Controlled Evolution, used by many scientists who should know better, may be inherently correct, but an incorrect usage of terminology.  Change my view.

t3_2kd1kx	CMV: The arts is not equal to the sciences.	"I would argue that there is no revolution in the field of arts that changes society the way a revolution in the sciences does. 

The Internet changed everything, and programming and IT is a scientific field.

The splitting of the atom has set the world into a stand-still of constant fear of a nuclear fallout.

The discovery of fire has allowed humans to be the now dominant species on this planet.

These were all the revolutions, all in the sciences.

What revolutions have changed the world in such an impacting way in the arts have occurred?

If none, do you think there could ever?

And even if there would never be such a revolution: what then justifies a continued exploration of the arts?

I now have adopted the stance, but am open to change in view, that the arts is only leisure, and can only be explored in times of surplus, which we definitely are not in such a time yet.

People are still starving, climate is still changing, the universe grows ever closer to its cold death, and many disagreements still go on. Not saying that times are worse, we are most definitely living in one of the most peaceful periods in history, but not devoid of conflict and suffering.

Because we are not devoid of conflict and suffering, should all our energies not be devoted to (in an ideal world) helping cure such suffering with technological advances or advances in the sciences? Does this make the arts a, for lack of a better term, ""relatively useless"" field?

t3_35rkzr	CMV: Nuclear war in the near future is inevitable until virtually all such weapons are eliminated.	"By near future, I mean 0 to 100 years. Given the irrationality of humanity, and the long history of systemic failures leading to the unthinkable, the presence of nuclear weapons represents an existential risk that is all too plausible.

The total yield of all nuclear weapons is measured in the *gigatons*. Though work has been done in the area of disarmament, the pace is far too slow to be meaningful. Even the presence of 20 modern nuclear weapons is an intolerable threat. 

But a nuclear war involving only 20 weapons is a pipe dream. There are thousands of 'active' nuclear weapons, ready to be deployed, and at the current pace of disarmament, any nuclear war within the next 100 years will involve *at least* hundreds of weapons, with a total explosive yield in the hundreds of megatons.

Even one is too many. If, for example, terrorists detonated a nuclear weapon of moderate yield in Manhattan, simulations have shown a total fatality amount of nearly a million. Economic damage due to both direct and indirect effects would likely be in the trillions. Geopolitics would be utterly and irreversibly destabilized for the foreseeable future. North Korea and Iran would suddenly appear to require immediate military intervention to forestall future attacks, and the American public would gladly endorse it.

This even would represent one of the greatest calamities in human history. Yet the threat of this pales when compared with a nuclear war involving multiple nations. In a full-scale nuclear war, immediate causalities would be in the hundreds of millions, potentially rising to billions depending on the extent of the war and the resulting collapse of infrastructure and climate stability. The very concept of a global economy would cease to exist. Humanity would be plunged into internecine conflict for decades, possibly centuries, as those still alive fought tooth and claw over the rubble of civilization. Suffice to say, short of an asteroid impact on the scale of Chicxulub, it is hard to imagine a worse fate for mankind.

Now, let me address the problem of mutually assured destruction. This subject really requires its own topic, but I'll try to be as concise as I can. All major nuclear arsenals are organized around this idea, and so they are kept ready at all times, waiting for the call. This is insanely dangerous, as it means any mistake or false positive will not simply cause some weapons to be launched in retaliation, but *all* weapons. Implicit in the idea of MAD is that any nuclear strike must be responded to with overwhelming force, and the response must happen **immediately**, long before the bombs start going off.  A submarine-launched ballistic missile would take less than 15 minutes to reach a major city - that is the window our leaders have to judge if an attack is real or imaginary. Mistakes and false positives of this kind [have already happened](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanislav_Petrov), and will surely happen in the future. We only need be unlucky once. 

If that weren't bad enough, we have the growing danger of missile defense initiatives, which although perhaps well-intentioned, serve to destabilize the already questionable state of nuclear deterrence. What happens when, for one country, MAD is no longer mutual? If you believe your only true means of defense is being taken from you, what response do you have left?

But here is what is really scary, what should truly frighten you: it doesn't frighten you at all. This is the great paradox of nuclear war. It is simply too big to fathom. Just like attempting to imagine the scale of the universe, our minds fail us. Because we cannot imagine it, we dismiss it as a kind of fantasy. I am guilty of this too. Here I am, writing this post with all sincerity, and yet to contemplate it doesn't disturb me one bit. Of course it won't happen, right?

I feel that this is the true peril we are facing. While our leaders may understand the threat intellectually, they have no visceral reaction to it. Not the reaction required to affect the needed changes to remove the threat. As history teaches us, world leaders are perpetually blindsided by what seems so obvious in hindsight.

We saw this with WWI: who would have thought one assassination would lead to a war killing millions? We saw this with 9/11: who would have thought it was so trivial to use commercial jets as weapons? We saw this with credit default swaps: who would have thought how easily they would cause systemic collapse of the economy? Who would have thought...

This where we are right now. The weapons are here, they are ready. The trigger need only the lightest pressure. And you aren't worried, you aren't worried at all.

t3_bzhgr1	CMV:How we generally look at how life should exist is flawed.	"I recently have been mulling this view over and trying to put in perspective for myself.

For starters, life as a whole and life on the scale of individual species are two different things to consider. We try to put a face on life based on the variety of life that has existed in the time frame of our lives.

evolution is a constant with ebbs and flows of species. global catastrophes like meteor impacts that reshape what life is are a constant given enough time.

Mankind wants to seemingly freeze evolution in an attempt to keep species alive and to keep populations flourishing that maybe should be diminishing. Whether the death of a species is caused by man or a natural event can't be validated at the moment, and we could end up looking like fools hundreds of years from now in our attempts to sustain certain kinds of life.

When it comes to the true nature of life, no species has a right to exist forever, that is not the nature of evolution and life.

Maybe our desire to give certain life value, is a vain cause to reach for. Maybe it's just important that life can exist in some way to grow into what it feels is necessary.

Maybe all the bad humans do to earth is supposed to be chalked up as another singular event on the long list of natural global catastrophes that life just has to readapt to as it always has.

It seems to me that the bad we do is just an organic event of how humans evolve no matter which planet we evolved on."	1	
t3_2dbnzs	CMV: I believe that some technologies have more downside and risk than many people are willing to acknowledge.	"(This is my birthday edition of CMV and I'm hoping that people will be able to engage in civil discourse without talking past each other and without using too many logical fallacies.  I will be back on a little bit later today to respond if anyone is so kind as to humor this submission.)   

I believe that some people have proverbial blinders on when it comes to the dangers posed by various technological processes.  They are dismissive of almost any negative claim about these technologies.  I believe this is due to a culture of technophilia and the cumulative PR work done to promote and defend these technologies.  

The two examples that come quickly to mind are nuclear power (not to be confused with solar power) and genetic engineering (not to be confused with natural selection or selective breeding).  

In the case of nuclear power... proponents suggest that all the nuclear power plants are perfectly safe and that a Fukushima/Chernobyl sort of disaster is all-but-impossible.  And yet, they still seem to feel that the nuclear power plants ought to be heavily guarded.  Why is that?  Is it because if they were unguarded that a horrible disaster might take place?  If that's so... then what if screening of employees ever fails?  Or, for that matter, what if a natural disaster overcomes the not-so-humble safeguards of such a plant?  EVERY nuclear power program spreads the propaganda that their program is safe.  They did so in Chernobyl, they did so in Fukushima, and they are probably doing for the sake of the plant on your horizon.  Unfortunately, accidents happen.  Mistakes are made.  And sometimes people do evil or ill-advised things.  In the case of nuclear power this could be incredibly tragic.  

As for the process of creating genetically modified organisms (horizontal gene transfer -- between species and even phylums [bacteria genes into plants, fish genes into mammals]), I find that many people have completely bought into the party line dished out by the biotech corporations.  I believe this is because the biotech firms had an easier time taking control of university agriculture departments than the fossil fuel industry had in trying to take over the climate science departments.  And the control of agricultural departments helped to facilitate regulatory capture and both of those things worked towards general control of the mainstream corporate media's coverage of the topic.  

It is my belief that GMOs present a potential hazard anywhere they are released.  You cannot adequately test in a lab or a control field is going to behave once it is released into the wild.  And, for this reason, I believe that any GMO has the potential to essentially act as a very problematic invasive species.  Slight changes in a plant, for example, could cause it to essentially become a weed.  Or it could promote or hinder various insect populations in unpredictable ways.  And while such things may seem minor to those who aren't familiar with potential problems posed by invasive species... such minor issues can completely devastate an eco-system.  And again... you can't test in a lab how a GMO species will behave when it is released.  A normal tomato crossed with another normal strain of tomato will likely produce a tomato that behaves in a relatively stable manner in regard to its environment.  But a strain with genes from a fish (to withstand cold) and bacteria (to serve as an internal insecticide) could have very different results -- because those genes have never been expressed in this manner before.  

I also believe that people don't take into consideration the fact that genetically modified organisms can intentionally be made to cause harm.  This could be anything from creating a voracious super-pest which breeds rapidly to engineering a dangerous virus or bacteria which could pose grave danger to human populations.  And so, I wonder how normalized this technology should be?  Who should have access to it?  How can we prevent access to it?  How much further do we want to simplify and advance this technology?  

This is merely a short list of problems that I see with two forms of technology.  I actually think the long list of problems would end up being too exhaustive.  And I don't mean to suggest that these are the only forms of technology which have the potential to get out of control and cause serious problems.  But I find that people don't really want to acknowledge the fundamental problems posed by these forms of technology.  In a way it seems as though many people today, especially online, have propped up science and technology as things which can do no wrong.  And they seem to thing the good outweighs the bad.  The problem is that destruction might be easier to bring about and it may be more permanent than any gains brought about by various technologies.  

How do you feel that I am mistaken?  Can you tell me in a way that doesn't involve four-letter words or that doesn't talk down to me?  Can you tell me in a way that doesn't involve logical fallacies?  Please?  For my Reddit birthday?

t3_35tsu6	CMV: Believing that free trade is bad despite near universal consensus among economists that it's beneficial is no different than believing that climate change isn't real despite near universal consensus among client scientists that it is.	"Free trade yields positive results for every country involved, and this is an established economic fact. Consumers in richer countries get to purchase goods at lower prices (which raises their standard of living) while poorer countries get capital investments and higher incomes (which raises their standard of living). Personally, I like that I can wake up, sip my Costa Rican coffee as I sit on my Swedish furniture and watch my Japanese TV before checking my Korean phone and getting in my German car to go to work for an American company that gets 90% of its revenue from overseas. If those goods all had to be made in America, they would probably be of lower quality because global competition is unequivocally good for consumers.

Despite this, ""free trade"" is still a controversial political topic. Reddit's two most popular politicians, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, have both promised to help stop jobs from being shipped overseas and have both been very critical of NAFTA, claiming that it has hurt America and has cost it hundreds of thousands of jobs. However, actual [peer-reviewed analysis](http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/trade/effects-of-nafta-on-us-employment-and-policy-responses_5k9ffbqlvk0r-en?crawler=true) that studied NAFTA after it was implemented suggested it had a negligible impact on American jobs (and a paper by Matusz suggested it had a very small but positive impact).

If a person doesn't believe in evolution or climate change despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then they are being anti-science. And I believe that if you think free trade is a net negative despite overwhelming empirical evidence and expert consensus to the contrary, then you're being anti-science. 

So, CMV and explain why free trade is a bad thing.

t3_3izu17	CMV: On the big issues evidence doesn't change people's views	"When I see debate about 'the big issues' (stuff like climate change, or gun rights, or public healthcare policy) people don't seem to particularly care about 'evidence'. If they shift on these issues, its for emotional reasons. 

Sure they'll have a few go-to facts or stats that are essentially cherry picked to support their view, or they may even be aware of the news, etc,(again to find info to support their position) but new evidence rarely changes people's minds.

If people did have beliefs based on evidence there'd be a greater diversity in the beliefs individuals held. As it is, if I know a person cares about climate change, odds are they are anti-gun rights and pro-choice. If they're big on border protection, they're gonna be small government and pro-gun rights. These are largely unrelated topics, yet at least 80% of the time people hold these 'suites' of ideas.

People seldom shift on these big issues, because views aren't evidence based, they're ideological. The few times people do change its because of one of two reasons.

An overall change in societal norms on the issue. Same sex marriage is a good example of this. This wasn't even on the agenda 20 years ago. There has been little 'data' to change peoples minds; we've just had a kind of cultural shift, and now its broadly accepted. It wasn't data or evidence that changed people's minds, it was a change in societies norms.

The other thing which I believe *can* change folks' minds is personal experience/change. I've known people to retire, or have  a health crisis, which shakes up their whole outlook, including views on ''the big issues. Or perhaps a personal brush with an issue-""My son came out, now I'm pro-same sex marriage""

So persuade me people are actually rational, and can be convinced by actual facts-CMV

t3_jtylxf	"CMV: ""The West"" is proving unable to deal with modern challenges"	"The events of 2020 have increased a nagging feeling I had for a while that ""the West"", by which I mean the industrialised, largely liberal democratic countries of western and central Europe, North America and Australia are failing to deal with the most acute challenges of the 21st century.

This is not a criticism of the governments or political parties exclusively. Rather, it's a more general disappointed with the trajectory societies seem to be taking. I realize the topic is extremely broad and this means there is a large risk I am selectively choosing pieces of evidence that suit a pre-existing notion. So I am going to try to give more specific examples of what I mean.

- The foreign policy has mostly ranged from ineffective to disastrous. Interventionism in the middle East has made things by and large worse for everyone. Russian aggression has only barely been curbed. Nor does anyone seem to have any idea what to do with China.

- Problems of immigration and outsourcing remain unresolved. Both issues continue to cause significant unrest and xenophobia in several countries, and a number of local economics remain devastated by the loss of entire sectors. The responses seem to be either ignoring the problem, or nationalism and xenophobia. But there seems very little in-depth consideration of what reaction we should have to the massive wealth inequality between regions.

- No credible planning for economic disruptions caused by climate change or by combatting climate change is in place. Most nations are barely able to survive the current, temporary crisis, let alone sustained changes to growth and economic structure that will likely be necessary in the future.

- Perhaps most critically, societies don't seem equipped to deal with social engineering backed by gamified and ""social"" media. China is heavily investing in these technologies to shape and control public opinion, and their power is obvious not least in the US. While the problem is certainly starting to be taken more seriously, it seems the political sphere is much too slow to adapt, and as a result there seems to be a credible possibility that liberal democracy is on it's way off the global stage again.

There seems to be a general lack of a perspective for the future, and thus the future of a ""western style"" as opposed to, say, the Chinese version of society and government, seems in doubt. Can you offer some hopeful notes for the future?"	1	
t3_4xkow6	"CMV:Invading countries for oil is justifiable, however can and should be avoided; oil companies should be taxed to finance social and research programs"	"I believe that oil is a natural resource, thus, it belongs to all inhabitants of Earth. However it so happens, it's located in some specific countries. So I think the right approach to get it would be to diplomatically negotiate at an international level, to distribute oil for all countries on earth according to their needs. 

If the leaders of those countries refuse, they are stealing and wrongfully appropriating a resource that is not theirs, but from all of us, so it's our right to go get our portion. However, wars should be the last resource, since they are messy and dirty and there are easier ways to get what we want, mostly throught black ops, which are much cleaner and more effective. 

What happens in countries with oil, mainly the middle eastern countries, is none of our business. If they want to kill themselves because they belong to different religious factions, that's their problem not ours. So our approach should only be to negotiate with them to get our needs supplied and to make sure they are able to keep their people in so they don't fload our countries and create problems. 
Asides from that it's not the duty of western countries to police tribal conflicts between them and that implies we shouldn't be biased. For example Europe and the US are allies with Israel and that just doesn't make sense. Israel doesn't have any natural resources that we need and they actually contribute to the destabilization of the region, so being allies with them is completely illogical and would hurt our ability to negotiate with other middle eastern countries who do have the power to control the people there. For example, Iran, Saudi Arabia and even Assad in Syria should be western allies instead of enemies (Saudi Arabia already is). Assad was western educated and a strong leader who kept religious fundamentalists controlled.


Now the second part of my argument. It's undoubtful that we need oil, it's impratical and illogical to say we can just stop using oil now and keep our way of living intact. We need to work on alternative sources of energies, but even the ones we have now are not enough to fully replace oil. So we need to finance new research mainly in nuclear fusion which is in fact the only source of energy that will be able to effectively replace oil and actually be cleaner than it.
So how will we finance it? Taxing oil companies. Now I understand that this could be a problem to libertarians. But we are wasting public resources on diplomats and often times wars to get oil that then those companies explore and profit with...so they should be taxed at an high rate and the money of those taxes should go to finance research programs on cleaner sources of energy.
And if we think about it, oil companies could actually benefit from it as well. In the future, oil will become obsolete and they will be out of business. So if they start investing now on research of new sources of energy they'll be able to keep alive in the energy market. 

I gave a thought to another option which would be to nationalize oil companies, but I don't think that's a good idea since governments are rarely good at managing businesses. 

It simply doesn't make sense that countries have to take on debt to invade countries and get oil and then oil companies get it for free and sell it at exorbitant prices to the citizens of those countries, and they are actually selling something that is from all of us. They of course have to profit something from it, because they supply the technology to explore oil, but still oil prices should be more regulated to avoid being subjected to speculations and oil companies should be taxed to finance the research programs on alternative sources of energy. 

I know this is a contradictory plan because I defend both left and right ideologies, but this is the only logical approach I find to cope with our energetic problem. However I'd appreciate if you could show me some data, I am good at thinking about stuff in general but awful at actually finding data.

"I will start by saying that I am welcome to having my mind changed because I don't really like or want to live a primitive lifestyle or the implications of said lifestyle but I see no other path for mankind and I am starting to believe civilization is possibly a mistake. To people who dont know what anarcho primitivism is here is the wiki. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anarcho-primitivism

I believe that the collapse of civilization is inevitable. From global warming, to the constant wars and disease that plague us and just the natural evil that lives within mankind I see no way out. It's starting to make me depressed and misanthropic. I believe the start of our issues was the invention of agriculture. Agriculture brought us inequality by allowing private property to exist and thus starting social classes and leadership, thereby the start of tyranny. It's been suggested by anthropologists that hunter gatherer tribes had no sexism and gender roles and that those only came to be after agriculture. Agriculture had effects on our health. Bad teeth, poor stature and creating many diseases that we suffer with today by living together in high dense areas, easily allowing disease to spread, disease that tribes never had to worry about before. And agriculture had terrible effects on our environment. Especially now post industrial.


According to science, our brains are evolved for hunter gathering. Not living sedentary lives. Look at the mental illnesses we suffer from today. It's because our psychology does not mesh well with sedentary lives.


Our advanced civilization is also destroying the planet. It is impossible for civilization to sustain itself. It is suicide. Nature was never meant to hold civilizations. In the end nature wins and we can do nothing to destroy it. Sustainability and renewable energy is a myth. We will run out of oil and not even nuclear energy is viable because materials to make nuclear energy is not renewable. Wind and solar will never be able to sustain our society. And with global warming happening, we are out of options.

I know that returning to a primitive lifestyle will leave billions of people to die. But what choice do we have. I see no other way out. And I don't even want to live in a tribal society. I would most likely end up committing suicide than living a primitive lifestyle. I imagine many other people would do the same. Maybe our evolution was a mistake. Maybe sapient life is a mistake. No matter which way we go, we have nothing but suffering waiting for us. Our entire life is nothing but suffering.

That was a bit off topic but these ideas leave me without hope. As I said I am eager to cmv if there is evidence that my thoughts are wrong."	1	
t3_78kktg	CMV: The Development of Nuclear Weapons has Made the World More Peaceful	"It is true that Nuclear weapons have the potential to cause greater suffering and death than any other single weapon, however, this potential results not in a more dangerous world, but rather, a more peaceful balance of power.  Hear me out... when deciding whether or not to use military action, nations weigh the cost of war with the benefit that can be gained.  Historically, nations have been willing to pay a very high price for a relatively small reward, but this calculus changes when nuclear weapons are added into the equation.  With nuclear weapons, there quickly becomes a point when the cost of engaging in war with another nuclear power becomes so great, that no benefit can be gleaned from engaging in military conflict.  Simply put, when the cost of war is guaranteed existential destruction, war no longer becomes an option.  If not for this concept, known as deterrence, the USSR and USA most certainly would have fought a war of unimaginable size during the 50's or 60's.  But because of deterrence, and the reality of mutually assured destruction, the USSR and USA never engaged in total war with one another.

In conclusion, war between nuclear armed countries will not occur because of deterrence and mutually assured destruction, and the relative peace we have enjoyed between the world's powers will continue to remain not in spite of, but because of nuclear weapons.  "	1	
t3_5hb8rc	"CMV:The Republican Party, as defined by its leaders, has insane and baseless ideas and policy positions with no similar equivalent on the left."	"This view  isn't that there aren't idiots on the left, or bad people, or hold policy positions that aren't great but are debatable.  I am not seeking to cherry pick a few people here and there, I am talking about the top of the party.  Also, saying Hillary Clinton is a criminal is completely irrelevant to the topic.  I'm not going into issues of character, although there is plenty of stuff I could bring up there.   The view purely relates to what both sides have claimed and advocated for in terms of policy and their worldview.

Trump has repeatedly made the claim that vaccines cause autism and we should thus engage in the costly policy of spreading out vaccinations.  The evidence he gave was that he saw a child get a shot from a big needle and soon after the shot, got autism.  He has no credible evidence for his position and there is overwhelming consensus among doctors that vaccines don't cause autism.  It's beyond incomprehensible and embarrassing to me that our future President believes in this.  

Trump has made similarly insane claims about climate change.  These claims are well documented and range from it's a Chinese conspiracy, to it's just a hoax.  It is one thing for a climate scientist to study the issue for years and come to the conclusion that the amount of GHG's produced by humans does not impact the climate.  It is another for a complete lay person to make a baseless claim.  

Trump just appointed a climate denying lawyer from a third tier trash college and law school to head the EPA.  He has literally no relevant experience aside from suing the EPA.  Also, say what you want about most standardized tests, but the LSAT actually does a really good job testing your ability to examine and evaluate arguments and conclusions.  It's probably telling that the best he could do got him into Tulsa.

Trump claimed Obama is the founder of ISIS.  When asked if he meant symbolic founder, he said no I mean literal founder.  I still think he was being hyperbolic and doesn't mean literal founder but it's still insane and embarrassing to make this claim.  

Trump has also claimed with zero evidence that 2-3 million illegals voted.  Again, he probably doesn't actually believe this because if he did he would already be getting a team together to investigate and prosecute this.  I guarantee in 4 years Trump hasn't investigated and prosecuted even a tiny percentage of the millions of people he claimed voted illegally.  

Trump has claimed NAFTA was a disaster and the worst trade deal ever.  Even if he's being slightly hyperbolic, the claim is still baseless.   The University of Chicago asked the opinions of 40 leading economists and 39 said they either strongly agreed or just agreed with the claim that on average, citizens of the U.S. benefited from NAFTA and just one said they weren't sure.  While figuring out the economic impact of NAFTA isn't an exact science, and there exists some small chance it was a net negative, Trump's position is baseless and absurd.

The Republican Chair of the House Science Committee is a Christian Scientist.  For those who don't know, Christian Scientists believe that all diseases are essentially just in your head and thus medicine won't work, only prayer will.  He also denies climate change.

Multiple Republicans, including Michelle Bachmann, have claimed that God told them to run for President.  I'm reaching a little with that one but it's indicative of their stances on policy matters and general reasoning ability.

t3_2yos3t	"CMV: People who are racists, bigots, religiously dogmatic can never be changed. The only way to weed out these negative traits from the society is to focus on the next generations being properly educated."	"People who hold back society through these personality traits have been comfortably settled in with these thought patterns. People, generally resistant to change won't change the views they have of the world and instead find ways to rationalize it to suit their ideology.

The only way to remove these traits (or at least minimize it to such an extent that it becomes a minor inconvenience at the most) is to invest on the future generations.

I acknowledge that every generation has a percentage of kids who are exposed to the ideologies of racism, supremacy, conservative and restrictive religious beliefs, and grow up to accept these ideas. But this percentage can be reduced with every subsequent generation.

t3_9ow87x	CMV: Vegans would have a better impact on supporting the welfare of animals in the food industry by supporting businesses and farms that treat their animals humanely	"If someone’s reason for becoming a vegan is the welfare of animals in the food industry, would it not be more effective to support the smaller businesses and farms that are trying to do it right - all while working against the market? If the only people that care enough about animals to make a change boycott the industry altogether, are they not paving the way for bigger, inhumane businesses and farms to dominate the market even more than they already do? 

I understand this does not deal with the environmental factors of animals in the food industry. I’m talking more about animal cruelty. There are definitely businesses and farms out there that treat their animals with the upmost respect. 

There are too few vegans to boycott the meat, dairy, and other animal product industries effectively. This would only mean the people that supposedly don’t care about animals are the only people left effecting the market. Surely these people will go for the cheapest options, which are usually provided through inhumane farming. 

I argue it would be more effective to support farms and businesses that take care and respect their animals by buying and consuming their products, even though they are usually more expensive. 

Again this would only apply to people who became vegan for the sole reason of boycotting animal cruelty within the food industry. "	1	
t3_7ehq0q	CMV: Extinction of endangered species is not a bad or important thing and we shouldn't be concerned with it	"
At the point when a species is marked as endangered, the species are already insignificant to the nature, not contributing to the food chain or the environment or anything. Their habitat is also likely destroyed and is now home to different species. The endangered species are only valuable to humans, who find joy at watching gifs of them on this reddit thing here. Or they have fancy fur. Or perhaps they are useful in medicine. Either way, the activities that are aimed at preserving these species are only beneficial to the humanity and are selfish by nature and not at all noble.

One might even say that by trying to preserve species that are hunted for, say, their 
ivory, or fur, we will only be incentivizing the unethical practice.


Human activities or other events that lead to species becoming endangered, however, is an entirely different matter, and not a topic of this CMV

t3_56npdc	CMV Those who think VR is a fad haven't tried Oculus Rift or Vive on a high end PC.	"Most people don't seem to be taking the imminent changes that VR implies seriously, some dismissing it as a fad or comparing it to past failed VR attempts. Being a Rift owner myself, and having tried room scale VR with the Vive, I can't imagine anyone that has tried high end VR being skeptical of its upcoming significant impact on our lives.

To change my view, I need to be convinced that a non-trivial number of people have tried Rift or Vive and still have good arguments why it won't significantly alter the future of humanity in the fairly near future.

I readily admit that there are few compelling applications to date, but it's a chicken and egg problem, as the market of people with hardware grows to support more substantial software development. From the hardware alone, in my opinion VR is set to change a significant part of our daily lives in the next few years.

Change my view."	1	
t3_3gxzsf	CMV:The popular reaction toward the Cecil lion incident was emotional and hypocritical	"First, I make the assumption that there is a very large intersection between people complaining about Cecil the lion's death, and people who eat meat.  Given the prevalence of meat consumption in the U.S., and the popularity of the outrage toward the incident, I think this is a reasonable assumption.  Keeping that in mind, here are my arguments, in order of importance.  

**1)** Cecil was 13 years old.  Males rarely even live to this age in the wild, so it was very likely that he would have soon been killed by another lion, had he been left alone.  Therefore, the damage done to the species is negligible.  

**2)** Meat production necessitates production of methane, which is [**25 times more more potent**](http://epa.gov/climatechange/ghgemissions/gases/ch4.html) than CO2 at warming the earth.  Beef and lamb (and other ruminants) are **very** high producers of methane, and animal agriculture is responsible for 26% of methane emissions in the U.S.  

Ruminant meat production (beef, lamb, bison, goat, etc.) also emits [an extremely large amount of CO2](http://www.theecologist.org/siteimage/scale/0/0/286401.jpg), which is the most familiar greenhouse gas in popular discourse.  Even pork and chicken emit 6 and 3 times, respectively, as much CO2 as vegetarian protein options.  

Meat is unnecessary for a healthy diet, and there's a lot of evidence that cutting out red meat (the meats which make up the lion's share, pun intended, of greenhouse gas emissions) is actually beneficial to human health.  There's also growing evidence that methionine restriction is beneficial to humans.  All animal proteins from mammals and birds are high in methionine, plant proteins are low in it.  

By eating meat on a regular basis, particularly red meat, one directly exacerbates global warming, which would not only severely threaten the lion population, but also most complex life on earth.  

**3)** Meat production also takes up far more space per calorie and per unit protein than plant production.  This means that native wild fauna are prevented from returning to their natural habitat, and if demand for meat rises, that they are also further pushed out of any remaining habitat they have.  

**4)** The dentist who shot the lion paid $50,000 to have that privilege.  The GDP per head in Zimbabwe is about $950, so his actions put 50 people's annual salaries into the country.  

**In summary:**  The lion was old, and had little value to the species.  Eating meat severely endangers all life on earth.  Eating meat also means further destruction of wild animals' habitats for pasture land.  The dentist also brought a large sum of money into the local economy in order to shoot the lion.  

Therefore, anyone who is morally outraged about Cecil the lion's death and also eats meat regularly, particularly beef/lamb, is a hypocrite.  Thus, the majority of the outrage comes from a place of emotion (discrimination), and is not morally justified.

t3_45gjcb	CMV: Childrens suffrage would not only be good for the country but good for our children. The voting age should be lowered.	"I support childrens suffrage, while I don't have a firm age that it should be lowered to I do believe it should be about as low as possible(no babies). Our children are completely powerless in society and that does nothing but harm them. It breeds cynicism and dis contempt for the political system. Children are effected by the government just as much as anyone else yet they have no say. They go to public schools, yet have no power in shaping them. Those who work pay into social security have no say in how their taxes are being spent. They are the ones who will bear the burden climate change longer than anyone, yet they are simply pawns in the argument for environmentalism. Today, we throw our kids into the political system at arguably the worst age; 18. At that age, especially after being so powerless for so long, most don't care to vote because it is a hectic time in a young persons life. 18 year olds are worried about college, or finding a job, or finishing high school, or falling in love, why would they start caring about anything political now? If we give our children more time to familiarize themselves with government than it would result in a much more informed and passionate electorate. Children represent our future and for all of our sakes they deserve a voice in moving towards it. They would be focused on big issues, on the issues that will shape the future becaus they are the future. If politicians had to appeal to such an un biased, fresh minded, voter bloc it would be huge in promoting discussion of issues that are left behind for petty squabbles in today's political climate.

t3_28ujb1	CMV: I believe that we should use prediction markets to choose policy.	"Prediction markets are essentially betting markets where the odds are set by market forces instead of bookmakers. They can be used to get systematically accurate forecasts for any measurable quantity, and can be combined to allow people to bet on combinations of events, e.g. the odds of unemployment going up given some change to the minimum wage. If we use representative or direct democracy to choose and weight the metrics we want to improve, and then use PMs to select policy proposals that show the greatest predicted improvement in these metrics, then we can avoid a lot of the problems in political discourse simply by saying to people ""Put your money where your mouth is.""

t3_azl80c	"CMV: Sustainable family farms and self-subsistence hunters are unjustifiably grouped in with large-scale factory farm operations for destroying the environment, and as a result many are viewing ""saving the earth"" as a horribly oversimplified ultimatum."	"I am a butcher in a rural state, and I work in a food co-operative with very strong emphasis on sustainable, local food options. I have experience with many local family farm operations first-hand and would say that I am fairly privy to how they operate and how sustainable they are.

Everywhere you go on the internet, a common answer to ""how can I help the environment"" is to give up \*all\* meat. Normally, I am one to shrug off nonsense like this, but what was shocking to me was simple \*how many\* people were saying this and believing it, so I feel as though with the experience that I have in a profession as ancient and highly regarded as husbandry, I am obligated to step in and give my 2 cents.

To preface: Yes, factory farms and horribly mismanaged large-scale swollen farms are playing a criminal role in destroying our planet. From mass deforestation, to poisoning the soil, to horrible mistreatment of animals, to contaminating watersheds, factory farm operations are wreaking havoc on our ecosystems.

With that out of the way: small family farms are not doing any of these things.

Animal husbandry has been around for as long as our history goes back, yet somehow suddenly only in the 20th century eating meat destroyed the environment? Absolutely not.

It's simply not that black and white. How in the world does my pork that comes from 5 miles down the road from me, have more of a negative effect on the environment than your avocado shipped across the country from Mexico? How does my butter from a farm down the road devastate the environment while your coconut butter shipped from across the ocean is helping it? How is the family that buys a half share of a cow up the highway, giving them meat for an entire year for their family of four more of an affront to the planet than families who only eat ""green"" foods shipped in from tropical states/countries nowhere near them? To beat the point further, how is the chick across town who grows her own produce and only eats the meat she hunts herself polluting the atmosphere more than her neighbor who scarfs down nuts, non-dairy milk, salad greens wrapped in plastic, and dried fruits from - again - half way across the country?

The pork farm? Animal welfare certified run just by a dude, his wife, and kids. The beef farm? A retired old couple who are running the family farm that's been in their name for generations. The chicken? Raised by a musician who keeps himself busy between tours with his wife and kids. Whenever I buy food from these people, I am supporting ethical farmers who know how important it is to take care of the land they use for their living, and who do what they can to be strong pillars of our community. I know who my money goes to, and I know that I am keeping more good, honest, hard working people in business, while keeping more money out of the hands of those who are destroying our planet.

I am not against vegans or vegetarians. I am not against people trying to help the environment. My point is that ""helping the environment"" is not as simple as ""not eating meat"".

I walk to work. I live within walking distance of all of my needs. I only drive to visit family or to reach trails/rivers. I work in a building that is more than 70% fueled by renewable energy, and takes my compost and recycling from me every week, and as a result my wife and I fill only one 30 gallon trashbag with actual trash a week. None of my clothes were made from slave labor, and I use minimal plastic-contained cosmetics (even my deodorant and toothpaste are recyclable, and my toothbrushes compostable). More than 90% of the food in my apartment comes from my state, if not my town. Especially my meat and fish, where if I can't tell you the farm or the shore it came from, I don't buy or eat. The pork up the road from me is animal welfare certified, the beef is a 15 minute drive up the highway, and the chicken roughly the same distance, and over the summer I grill my own perch, bass and trout I catch. I eat meat for breakfast, lunch and dinner, proportionally less than the grains and vegetables I buy which are locally grown (Exception being rice, can't grow that where I am, and I buy in BULK stored in a glass jar I reuse). The biggest carbon footprint I have is actually coffee. My biggest contribution? I avoid fast-food restaurants and chains like the plague, and only begrudgingly eat from them if I didn't prepare food well on a road trip.

Yet, asking the right people, I am destroying the environment simply because I eat meat, and nothing else I listed matters. Yet any vegan (again nothing against vegans, and don't mean it as a negative word, a vegan is just simply the best opposite to myself I can use) is seen as a herald of environmentalism, even if they commute by highway 30 minutes each day, barely recycle, buy insane amount of plastic-wrapped snacks and tofu (or even worse, the invasive jackfruit from southeast asia), or only buy marketed vegan proteins that don't even come from a neighboring country. All the while putting their money in the pockets of businesses you don't know in different countries, while my money is going straight back into my own economy. Where is the sense in this that I am missing?

In the end, it is not a matter of if you eat meat or not which helps the environment, but rather your lifestyle as a whole. If you give up all meat, yet still don't take any other measures to reduce your carbon footprint, chances are you are not being nearly as productive as you think you are.

t3_4clucy	CMV: There should be a global one-child policy	"I am aware of the fact that there is no overarching administrative body that could put a policy in place for all nations worldwide, but if we assume that is hypothetically possible, i believe that is the best way to deal with the resource allocation, environmental issues such as global warming, and the wealth gap. 

The population growth rate is 1.2% currently on the planet. China has gone from 2% down to 0.5% while the policy was in place. 

Of course, generational dependancy and working population proportion is the big concern, but with a proper management and such a tremendous leaps in productivity, i don't think we should have a problem supplying, what would be a relaxed demand for goods and services.

t3_ajww2l	"CMV: The future threat of war, failed states or economic collapse is a good reason to oppose nuclear power"	"Building a nuclear power plant is a century-long commitment that can't be stopped once it's started. Their safety requires a stable society around them, you need engineers who can maintain the facility, infrastructure to keep waste fuel cool.

Anyone building such a power plant today is making the arrogant assumption that their society will be stable enough, their ruling powers wise, concerned and wealthy enough and their people will be skilled enough to look after the waste until about 10 years after the last plant is decommissioned.

There are currently reactors with an operational lifespan of 60 years being built in countries that are extremely fragile right now, and WW2 was only 70 years ago. While we can't pre-empt bad things happen, we know that some are likely to. History shows us that countries do become failed states, they have civil wars, infrastructure is destroyed, rebel groups take power. What's the odds of Pakistan or Bangladesh suffering a year of chaos in the next 70 years? The more countries with nuclear power, specially ones high up on the fragile states index, the greater the risk. Plus this isn't just 70 years, countries will stop building them when they become a bad economic deal, so any reactor being built now likely means more in the future, extending the window of danger.

So I think we will see a few more Chernobyls and Fukushimas in the next 100+ years and I object to the proliferation of nuclear power on those grounds - it's extremely arrogant to think your society will survive the next 70 years without conflict serious enough to compromise nuclear infrastructure.

What I'm not getting is why does nobody talk about this? I must be wrong, right? Someone please change my view."	1	
t3_4xl1m3	"CMV:I have little faith in the governments and people of the world to solve serious environmental issues in a timely manner, especially in the oceans."	"I am going into the field of marine biology, so my passion for the ocean, as well as nature in general, may blind me. Hopefully I'll be steered to see past this. 

Over the past year, I've read of more and more articles testifying to the alarming rate at which fragile natural ecosystems are collapsing. In particular, our control of CO2 and its absorbing into the sea does not seem to be getting any stronger. 


Coral reefs are an urgent matter, as the bleaching of many coral species leaves them devastated in large numbers, prone to disease and a sickly white color. The great barrier reef, the largest and best-known reef in the world, is [suffering from complete ecosystem collapse](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/21/sections-of-great-barrier-reef-suffering-from-complete-ecosystem-collapse) in many sections, and other reefs including the Great Reef and those in the Maldives suffer from [large percentages of bleaching](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/asia/maldives/articles/maldives-devastated-by-coral-bleaching-as-2016-shapes-up-to-be-hottest-on-record/). There are estimations of money and effort in which governments and the people can fix them, but I doubt any major authority or social movement will change that within the time it needs done. Other examples of the abuse of human power include overfishing of many species, leading to a potential food supply collapse, which would affect billions living on the coast. A lot of the apathy can be attributed to the anti-environment stances of many conservative politicians in the US.

Basically, the saddening situation of many places of ocean paradise can be applied to rainforests, endangered species, you name it. Most governments care too much about (in my opinion) less important short-term issues than the long term issues that may affect the generations to come. I believe it is our duty as the dominant power in the world to keep watch and protect every species. I love the oceans and cannot wait to do my part in helping solve the issues that plague them, however, I do not think I can count on the people in power to help solve the problems any time soon.

I'll leave it at this phrase that comes to mind, I found it on reddit one day - ""The best way to get depression is to go into the field of marine sciences.""

t3_hy5vfw	cmv: Tourism should stay how it is currently	"Firstly, I know the arguments made here are for reduced tourism regardless of a pandemic or not however, I also understand that the change given things were normal would be much more heavily contested and widespread. However, given the current situation, I believe we've been given an opportunity to make a permanent change since the industry is already plunged into chaos and uncertainty.

**Argument 1 (the most obvious), climate change:** [Tourism was growing at a rapid rate](https://www.unwto.org/international-tourism-growth-continues-to-outpace-the-economy) and there didn't seem to be any signs of slowing down [and has nearly doubled in the past 13 years, that's an additional 700 million people each year. Broken down, most is leisure with business and visiting family members making up a significant proportion as well.](https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/pdf/10.18111/9789284413560) Yet the environmental impacts have been clear, currently air travel makes up around [5% of climate emissions](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/254367178_'It_Does_Not_Harm_the_Environment'_An_Analysis_of_Industry_Discourses_on_Tourism_Air_Travel_and_the_Environment) which doesn't seem like much as a percentage but if you consider how much we produce each year, it's very much substantial. However, it was previously projected that it could reach [15% due to small amount of frequent travellers](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228417034_TourismLeisure_Greenhouse_Gas_Emissions_Forecasts_for_2050_Factors_for_Change_in_France) and [improvements in plane technology will not be enough to offset the growth with people refusing to taking actions themselves](https://pdf.sciencedirectassets.com/271844/1-s2.0-S0966692310X00023/1-s2.0-S096669230900101X/main.pdf?X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAIaCXVzLWVhc3QtMSJHMEUCIQCOz9motabqOO72NiV63ALgfjXtZLsgf7LIaYnU%2Fy2I0AIgJ9qP%2B9fw2Cc4B3Uhop7a93MckkYnOLQYzrFpdS8uBhUqvQMIuv%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FARADGgwwNTkwMDM1NDY4NjUiDK0OO60OlUQ6XT6%2BwiqRA5GTWgUqVYO7S1bdworVPymQN4FnHM%2Bd1CMWfQYumKhYfc0ZBpV1FYYeVWKYjFZLQlZoicdmOu4YJI49iJPlBeHkjJ6Ur4dNOvc23GanxAqZlEiDlvwWkvCh1VNCBkrq2OhDI%2BRPShLgU48ASqBWdAb2BAc2WoNhQ%2BM1ZAjn%2FAwOD5jGu0uod13oCeEqJrO5bCCZNoEB4waBbNnB2yR1BNTmZ96rw5qYAVAQUleuUSz7X3NZEEqEAH%2FD2g4k9126No3cAAdoLOvoXvjwm%2BtiFfv79G3gFL8zjTIjL%2FvApxirIwBk52RH5UGSV0c%2Fyft9RkEz5XFtxsNG9woqQRek4bKB7zv1xpAN4xHIlPPG%2BepUM0g5%2BS9DuxHrrKZYJNkeYah6a0UWAtVVtMlqBZRIMI3zd%2BbxHRwUPZk3WUuU8J2W2ZK73ZA0xt1dIEdeI2Emx8us9FWOdQ%2F1fAsoZxYn9kpDQtNOHGrYSDPQGdXyFcQXq0gIQlzuLpsgCyiAE%2FggExesCNmQEhIPh5pOS4nYyCcoMOyS9fgFOusBGYC%2FM5yaT8qWujyhwzha1MIppbMBzzt1OCKGhnW4IDSXvYh%2F61HYR7Cffl852GH3rFIhngwOo8R9L8rcfff6amuV2g0bpjyQdPODH6xuBq8PWo7mfSmeItk%2FiybcY%2FcLZaCvv%2BwfD%2F9%2BLOHZGoFCetMW3%2BUtQ4dR891iYeB%2BuGZa%2Bd4VhvMFb3UCpM6N1eRw%2BrChehAyUz%2Fl8tnFgnrqI9Km5gpZTlPcKrC8ePAd3Q9mMIy7ENpsF8oLrOYoMWfFeGOhqVKuZjn0OAbMqKL10q85UwDY8kd1QA2bykIAtdmXbq70qirvH7cbqQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20200726T103343Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=300&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAQ3PHCVTY26B4H57C%2F20200726%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=057f263b7203861cf3e9ccc64f853e2fbbd217b3dcc40afa53bca2067fc09dba&hash=718af0afa0c1e4b8de10e50320940714b5a6660a08addf7662e9532d88746478&host=68042c943591013ac2b2430a89b270f6af2c76d8dfd086a07176afe7c76c2c61&pii=S096669230900101X&tid=spdf-5e21bdc3-278f-4acc-8c8f-e63fefad0aea&sid=a8357df4468e89457298801523ef6c3aea28gxrqa&type=client). Moving away from the global scale of CO2 emissions and also the fact that they are being emitted directly into the atmosphere with other toxic chemicals, the physical damage of cruise ships and ice breakers, the pollutants in the sea, let's have a look at a specific example, viewing polar bears which has [caused a reduction in their health and population (by 22%) due to thinning of ice](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09669580903215147?src=recsys&journalCode=rsus20) and what really made that paper sickening is that only 7% didn't know think that their actions were having an impact meaning the rest knew but went anyways and, from the paper, was a driving force for them (that is, polar bears becoming extinct). Now I would love to see polar bears as much as the next guy but I understand that a population supersedes my 1 day desire. Clearly other people don't, thus restrictions need to be set in place to prevent the selfishness of others.

&#x200B;

**Argument 2, impact on housing prices and community:** We've seen it all on Reddit, how people rejoiced at the current demise of Air BnB as people mentioned how [increases in house pricing due to tourism](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0261517719300858) pushed them out of the market with a[nother example in Spain](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13683500.2019.1705768) with people in Barcelona [fearing tourism over unemployment](https://inequality.org/research/mass-tourism-drives-inequality/). I also remember watching a video about Venice with locals protesting tourism due to what their city had been turned into. I have spoken to friends in Japan whom viewing cherry blossoms was an annual family tradition but now they have to compete with tourists to get a spot. This to me is just sad. Plenty of sacred and traditional temples or buildings just packed to the brim with people taking photos and a Starbucks and McDonalds. I have also visited Bali and was disheartened seeing the entire area being turned into one giant souvenir shop pampering to people who had greater currency. What this does is that provides a disincentive for the community to be self reliant as well as [poor households being negatively impacted by rising cost of goods](http://www.ccsenet.org/journal/index.php/ijbm/article/download/11572/8185). Of course I'm not doubting the positive impacts it may have, it's not all doom and gloom but I'm just highlighting some of the negative impacts and that not all the [money goes to where you think it does.](https://www.odi.org/blogs/4717-tourism-poor-places-who-gets-what)

&#x200B;

**My own opinion:** To me, I have to consider what all this environmental damage is for and that is mainly leisure, a brief period in time where someone has fun (and who wouldn't when you are relieved of all responsibilities and just sight seeing 24/7) that causes everlasting damage. It's just a bit of fun at what expense? Tourism has somewhat become a right in the Western world that it's become normalized that it's really not that unique anymore. People just go because their friends went, they saw it on television or just want to take good Instagram photos (literally what I see 99% of people do) and by the bus loads. It's not as if people engage with anything. Museums and heritage sites are just eye candy and hardly anyone is interested in the history not to mention they'd probably never even visited museums or sights in their own country which I always find off. I'd probably never see a polar bear, the top of mount Everest or the lost city of Atlantis but honestly sometimes watching those documentaries or the imagination is enough if not better. Sometimes going to the actual place can be really underwhelming.

&#x200B;

I understand, I saw the figures when doing my research. Plenty of economies and livelihoods rely on tourism but there's a clip from [Elon Musk](https://youtu.be/zIwLWfaAg-8?t=2133) where he states the reason he does what he does instead of solving issues like poverty is basically he looks at the bigger picture, humanity moving forward. We are in a time where tourism is at an a historic low and these industries have been crushed for an indefinite period of time. Plenty of people have been forced to pivot and it demonstrates how fragile the industry is. Areas that might have been richer than others due to tourism now have been plunged into fear. I'm worried about areas such as Bali but hope they use this time to rebuild themselves more sustainably and take back some of their heritage. Secondly, I'm not saying there aren't other issues causing climate and I'm not saying we shouldn't tackle them so please don't change topics. I'm not saying it will be easy or that there won't be sacrifices nor do I have all the answers. What I do *know* is that if it were to be implemented (some sort of permanent drastic reduction to tourism) we can, will and *have to* adapt. I'd rather deal with this and reduce the catastrophic impacts of climate change later. I think to be able to wipe of 5% of CO2 emissions (or up to 15%) later would be a great achievement."	1	
t3_45hnvx	CMV: Diets that include meat are superior to a vegetarian diet	"Many arguments that vegetarians make against eating meat are generalizations and are mostly false. For example, the claim that meat harms health is dependent upon many factors, one of which is the carelessness of the consumer about how much meat is in his/her diet. In fact, meat is more convenient as a protein source because it can provide all the essential amino acids and nutrients in one serving, while plant foods provide inadequate levels of nutrients in one serving. According to the T. Colin Campbell Center for Nutrition Studies, in an article written by T. Colin Campbell himself, “Animal based proteins, of course, are much more similar to our proteins, thus are used more readily and rapidly than plant proteins. That is, ‘substrate’ amino acids derived from animal based proteins are more readily available for our own protein synthesizing reactions which allows them to operate at full tilt. Plant proteins are somewhat compromised by their limitation of one or more amino acids.”


Environmentally speaking, vegetarian diets are not necessarily better for the environment than non-vegetarian, because I can argue that a vegetarian diet causes an increase in the use of weed-killing herbicides which are toxic to plants and fish. Again, the arguments for environmental causes are too broad: human practices that threaten the environment can not be used as an excuse to argue that killing animals for food, or planting food is harmful to the environment, it is the method with which these are done that is to blame and that can always be solved. 


I think that the moral argument against eating meat is false and unfounded, not to mention the fallacy of elevating animal life over plant life. Every animal will eventually die or be killed; it is natural to kill for food. What is not ethical, however, is torturing animals before they die, or giving them a slow death. Again, that can be solved by finding ways to kill them without feeling pain. 


Clearly, an unbalanced diet composed of only meat is harmful, and a vegetarian diet is less efficient in delivering the nutrients needed by the body. So a balanced diet of meat and vegetables is superior to a vegetarian diet. CMV

t3_2vswlp	CMV: I don't think we have an obligation to make sure the human species lasts forever.	"A lot of people use the inevitability of eventual extinction to justify things like space exploration (and even eugenics on some CMV threads). The general line of thought is that ""if we do this, we stand a better evolutionary chance of being around in the distant future.""

I think that when it comes to the distant future, the existence of the human race is irrelevant to us. Instead of spending millions or billions of dollars doing things like space exploration, we would be better off using that money on the issues we have today.

I compare it to a human being's life. Sure, living forever sounds good in theory. But if you think about it, an eternal life probably isn't all it's cracked up to be and it's probably preferable to most people to have an average life that's more fulfilling than living forever just so you don't die.

That's not to say that I don't think that things like climate change are an issue for immediate survival for our world. But instead of trying to explore space, we should use those funds and effort to focus on either stopping/slowing climate change, or providing humanity with the technology and resources to live through climate change and a worsening global climate.

t3_1fdu9t	I think being vegan/vegetarian for a cause doesn't make sense. CMV	"Nowadays, most vegans or vegetarians don't eat animal flesh or don't consume anything animal related in order to prevent harm and keep balance in nature. I usually see oversensitive statements regarding how much we should care about animals and how they suffer during food industrialization process. The thing that keeps bugging my head is that in a regular natural environment, the trophic chain is nothing but a true slaughter where the most adapted kill and eat the weaker ones (and I believe that being torn apart by a lion is worse than being slaughtered by a butcher). That being said, I believe there's no reason to bother about veganism since it's natural behaviour of every natural being. Change my view, fellow Redditors."	1	
t3_6k2n9z	CMV: I am anti GMO Corporations.	"I distrust Monsanto and other Big Agriculture to act ethically with the tool of GMO. This has made jumping on the Pro-GMO band wagon very hard even though I see the benefits and I know there is no evidence of harm. (I am not Anti artificial selection, but splicing jellyfish DNA into rabbits to make them glow is not the kind of stuff I want to eat)

This is one of those things where I feel like I know there is a scientific consensus that GMO's are perfectly safe, but there a much bigger ethical and environmental concerns about food that need to be addressed. Can big Agra be trusted not to reduce biodiversity, drain soil nutrients, value nutrient density over yield, release more carbon, and damage habitats? 

To me the most probable outcome is GMOs will help many people, but big Agra will use them to continue the unethical practices and their oligopoly of what we eat.

Their voices are drowning in a sea of hate and ignorance and other evils. 

The human species is an abomination that must die.

We are cancer.

from a now deleted reply

*The world and nature doesn't give two shits about right and wrong. You're anthropomorphizing the world. The world doesn't get cancer and it doesn't think of things as good, bad, abominable or reverential. The world just is. Nature doesn't give a fuck about you or me, it doesn't give a fuck about apes, it doesn't give a fuck about cute penguins and polar bears and all the crap inside of it. Nature can send an asteroid hurtling to Earth and slaughter everything that's alive, and nature wouldn't give a damn because nature doesn't think*

*You're the only one who cares about nature. If we die tomorrow, guess what? Apes will keep fighting and evolving into making better weapons and killing each other. Tigers will mercilessly slaughter children right in front of their mothers, and won't think twice about it. Hyenas will eat an aging father alive because he couldn't keep up with his kids and grandkids, and no one will think twice about it. Animals will continue raping other animals, and slaughtering each other*

*Fuck your morals. The world is amoral and doesn't give two shits about it. So don't bother with your ""mass extinction"" tears around here. The sun's going to explode in a blink of an eye and fucking slaughter everything you care about. Get over it, because nature and the world already has*

*The only thing that human are a threat to are themselves. You sound like a 5 year old who has a bad day in preschool and thinks because of that, school is pointless and serves no purpose. You think your insignificant problems mean anything to the broader nature and world? Just stop with that. Humans are fucking animals just like everyone else. We kill, we rape, we're selfish, and all that crap. We kill for security and territory, and if you think that's unnatural then go do jumping jax next to a bear's nest and fucking see what momma bear does to you. It'll make nuclear war seem like a goddamn joke, and if that bear had nuclear weapons and had the mental capacity to think strategically, and think 10-20 years in the future, you can bet your ass that bear would fucking nuke all of us because it would see us as an eventual threat. We're just animals who happen to have better brains and strategic capabilities than other animals. You don't have a problem with humanity, you have a problem with life, which seeks to survive, thrive, and propagate*

*Don't bother us with your sob stories about the world and talk like humans are any worse than other animals. If you want to roll over and die, go for it. But don't tell me that I and my kids can't be good people and live a good life, and don't tell me that I have to lose hope in humanity because we don't live up to some stupid standards that you don't put on any other animal, and don't tell me that I have to believe all your moralizing about the world when a fucking tsunami wipes out half a million poor people in the blink of an eye. Guess what? The world doesn't care about us. So if you want a better society, then you're the one who has to care. If you don't want to be bothered to care, then fuck off. Humanity has enough people who do care that we're still trying to be better, because the world and Momma Nature isn't going to come tuck us all in and make us feel safe. The fact that you even have the goddamn frame of reference and cultural morals to even think about what we're doing to the planet is because of OTHER FUCKING HUMANS and scientists who gave a shit about the world enough to give you that frame of reference. You're like a 12 year old who just discovered that the world is unfair. We've been working on it long before you realized it, we'll be working on it long after you and I die, and the fact that you even know about that unfairness is a testament to how far we as stupid apes on this rock have come. I'm not interested in snuffing out our progress just because you can't handle the information that other humans who care about the same thing you do have come up with*

t3_93y0nf	"CMV: Environmentalists, animal lovers, and pacifists are hypocritical if they eat meat."	"The number ~~one~~ two cause of global warming today is eating meat. The number one cause of animal cruelty is factory farming. And lastly, the number one source of violence human beings commit is against other species. 

If one is a pacifist and finds violence abhorrent, and yet eats meat, then one is hypocrite. If one professes a love for animals and finds them pure and innocent, and yet supports killing them before they have lived out their life, generally in terrible conditions, then one is a hypocrite. And lastly, if one is interested in reducing carbon emissions and thinks that global warming is an existential threat to humanity, and yet one does the act in their daily life that most contributes to greenhouse gase, then one, again, is a hypocrite. (This also applies to world hunger, water shortage, and waste in the ocean) 

To conclude, if you state that you support the above (which, statistically, most liberals do) yet do not follow through in your daily actions, then there is a disconnect between your stated beliefs and your actions. To put it more harshly, it is a hypocrisy, as liberals are asking others to change (namely, conservatives/overall federal policy) instead of changing themselves.

t3_3boicm	CMV: People who are vegans for ethical reasons but do not take political action to drastically reform factory farms have no moral superiority to people who are not vegans but do take such action.	"This comes from the perspective of an omnivore (even if I wanted to be a vegan, I've been told by my doctor that I'm seriously underweight and deficient in animal protein). I do feel that being a vegan who is politically active is the most ethical option by most standards, but a vegan who is not politically active doesn't have any claim to this. One person going vegan is of course not going to change anything, but that's because changing one's diet won't help. If one person won't buy meat, someone else will. In order for change to occur, there has to be a significant element of activism. Without that, the point of being an ethical vegan is defeated- the person thinks that harming animals is wrong, but is unwilling to take any action that would have any impact.

By contrast, a vegetarian or omnivore who does take action does have some claim to ethicality with regard to food choice. Even if what the person eats is a product of animal suffering and/or exploitation, the fact that they are taking action to reform factory farms through activism or lobbying means that they aim to actually fix the problem, as opposed to simply removing oneself from it.

TL;DR: Vegans who have only removed themselves from the problem have no claim to ethical superiority over non-vegans who have become part of the solution through activism.

t3_p9hwaj	CMV: The US should focus on its own problems and stay out of other countries’ internal affairs.	"There is no legitimate reason I can think of, especially at this point in time, for US leaders to be meddling around in the internal affairs of other countries. With all that is happening within the US, the current priorities of US leaders seems far away from where they should be. Most, if not all, focus should be on mitigating the disastrous effects of climate change, mobilizing against the pandemic, preparing for an inevitable eviction and financial crisis etc.

Instead of dealing with issues at home, US leaders and media have decided it’s more important to interfere with the affairs of countries like Cuba, China, and others. Instead of using American tax dollars to aid American citizens, they’re going to bomb other countries. Instead of dealing with crumbling infrastructure, rampant poverty, and other crises prevalent in American communities, US leaders are ignore and neglect the needs of the American people in their own country in favor of expensive, imperialist foreign policy.

The constant meddling of US leaders in other countries seems to always takes priority over the needs and concerns of every day, working class American people, families, and communities. And while they love to hide their exploits behind notions of protecting our “national security” or fighting for “democracy” and “human rights” it’s much more about protecting the political and economic interests of the wealthy and powerful. It very rarely ever actually is about helping anyone.

Additionally, the problems of other countries should not be American problems. And more often than not, the US is in some way responsible for most of the world’s problems that US leaders claim they want to solve. Nearly every action the US has ever taken abroad has been detrimental to both Americans and the people of the countries destabilized by US involvement in some way. So if our leaders refuse to address the crises already afflicting Americans, they should cease meddling in the internal affairs of other countries altogether."	1	
t3_2hrb8e	CMV: I don't believe that the hatred of GMO's is justified	"I see no reason to hate GMO's, assuming that they aren't directly hurting (unknowing) consumers. I understand the hate of Monsanto itself, of course, due to their unethical business practices, such as suing farmers and other GMO creators for this or that, and buying politicians and court judges, and the like. But Monsanto and GMO aren't one-and-the-same.

On top of that, we're soon going to hit a point in world population growth that we'll **need** Genetically Modified Crops in order to even feed people.

GMO's are improving our way of life as we speak, and I see no reason to prevent that progression.

Also, on a more political/controversial side of things, I see the whole situation as the free market fixing problems that need fixing, and I feel that if we interfere with that, it's not only interfering with Capitalism (I know not everyone supports that one here, I'm just saying), but it could stifle our progression towards higher crop-yields, better quality crops, and so on- something that, I would hope, nobody here wants.

t3_2gx4ip	CMV: Conservatism is Dead	"I feel the correct basis for conservatism (and I am a conservative) is the opposition to radical change (what some call progress). These are the kind of principles espoused in Edmund Burke's *Reflections on the Revolution in France*, which I have just read.

I would say that because conservatism is the idea of limiting progress, the two primary types of conservatives in the modern world (neo-liberals, and neo-conservatives) have failed in being legitimate conservatives and inputing legitimate conservative policy. They have actually been pushing an agenda of progress which actually countermands tradition and preservation.

Firstly, neo-liberalism. I will deal mostly with Thatcher in the UK here, since my grasp of the policies of Reagan is not strong, although it is ok. Thatcher essentially led a programme of privatization. This was a ridiculously radical action. Thatcher believed the free-market would solve everything, and as such destroyed not just the bloated government labour had created, but also many political institutions that had existed in the UK for many years. The destruction of government institutions is not inherently conservative, in fact I would say it is progressive. It is a belief that changing the way we have lived for hundreds of years in favour of a entirely different system is good for society, when it is in fact an instrument of radical change. Conservatives should be concerned with preserving long-held values, not creating new ones. 

Secondly, the neo-conservative movement. The idea that through military intervention we could create a global, free-market democratic society is a utopian notion. In fact I would draw attention to how Burkean philosophy is inherently opposed to this, because Burke says that a tyrannical government being removed is not at all likely to lead to liberty, and we shouldn't enshrine abstract rights over concrete effects.

I would say a real conservative policy, one that **conserves** our values and democratic system rather than destroys it would be something like as follows, which no modern conservative supports:

(1) Anti-Globalization

Globalization results in our values being undermined because we have to  push a program of free trade and free immigration which actually rewards us (in the form of profits and wages) for abdicating our values (Citizen employment and traditional small business) and our stability (trade deficits/budget deficits).

(2) Anti-Growth

Modern conservatives push a program of deficit spending to expand our economy which only results in long-term disaster. Additionally, unrestrained economic growth can result in pernicious new industries which undermine our values and destroy the environment that is so important to the well-being of humans.

(3) Pro-Localism

Local communities are undermined by multinational corporations, and central governments that want to push a narrative of global free trade and economic progress. The utopian experiment of multinational government has failed and we need to prevent the kind of value conflict that could occur. Citizens should be allowed to preserve their values, and should not be forced into accepting radical change from halfway across a continent, or forced into a global system to preserve their livelihood.

tl;dr Real conservatism is dead because modern conservatives undermine our values by pushing progress and economic growth at all costs, rather than defending long held principles and values.

t3_363i1f	"CMV: If a killer asteroid were headed to Earth, Humans would be able to stop it."	"I say ""killer asteroid"" in the title for brevity, but I mean any celestial object (asteroid, comet, planetoid, etc) large enough to wipe out life on Earth.

I have three basic reasons:

1. We know there are no planet-destroyers in the Asteroid Belt, which means anything that'd take out Earth would need to come from the Kuiper Belt or the Oort Cloud.  Both of these are very far away, and would give us lots of warning, even if the object were presently on its impact trajectory orbit.  More likely, we'd detect it multiple orbits in advance, and have decades or centuries before predicted impact.  But I think we'll at least have multiple years.

2. Nuclear weapons would be pretty effective at deflecting an object.  They are very energy dense, and [we can use a standoff detonation](http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html) to cause ablation on one side of the comet/asteroid and nudge it.  We only need a very slight nudge to push it off of an Earthbound trajectory when it is far away.

3. If an impact were imminent, humanity would throw all feasible resources into stopping it.  A lot of the things which make present space travel difficult would be overcome fast.  We would allow launches which have a high chance of spreading radioactive debris onto Earth for instance, or which have a high chance of loss of human life.  We might even send astronauts on a suicide mission.  Of course, money would be no object for this, and massive logistical resources would be poured into anything with a chance of saving us.

"The doomsday clock is at 2.5 minutes to midnight (https://www.thenation.com/article/the-doomsday-clock-is-now-at-two-and-a-half-minutes-to-midnight/). We haven't seen that since the height of the cold war.

This is due to our species awful reaction to climate change (""climate change? Let's make an economy where it is fine to buy a new phone every 12 months!""), the rise of the far right nationalism across the world (the US, the UK, Europe etc), the slow breakdown of globalisation and that guy who gets mentioned on here every ten minutes (Cheezit Hitler). This leads me to the only rational conclusion you can: our species won't make it to 2100 (or if we do, it will be the dregs who will be killed off by the air having too much nitrogen in it or whatever). There is no hope of humans pulling off an about turn, because to do so would require a complete restructuring of our society that very, very few will be willing to commit to. We are on the road to a mass reduction of the human population in our lifetime that I don't believe we can recover from.

t3_5w0d2p	CMV: Nuclear Energy is a requirement for converting to a green economy	"First let me define a green economy as I understand it: in a green economy all sources of electricity are generated using energy sources that have virtually no carbon emissions except for when they are built (e.g. solar, wind, hydro and nuclear). Apart from that any carbon emissions have to be absolutely unavoidable.

And second: I will state that it is necessary for any alternative energy source to be able to compete with coal/oil/gas to if we want the world to convert to a green economy.

So why do I think nuclear energy is necessary?

I am aware that solar and wind are becoming more and more efficient and cheap. In particularly sunny and/or windy places they are already able to compete with fossil fuels. 
The problem is, that they are only able to compete when the sun is shining bright and/or the wind is blowing hard. So in a night with little wind fossil fuels will have to be burned anyways. 
So the answer to this point usually is: we'll use batteries!!!

Okay, but you do realise the price tag just got a lot higher, putting a battery in every house for the night is going to make it impossible to compete with coal. (okay, I don't actually have a source for this, but I know batteries are expensive and I assume they will make it impossible to compete with fossil fuels because of it, if you have a reliable source disproving this, please go ahead and blow my mind)

Even if the battery problem is solved, there is still an issue with the fact that there are simply areas on the world with no sun in the winter and little wind.

So why nuclear?

So you might say uranium is expensive as fuck and is not able to compete with fossil fuels. And I'd say you're right.
However, Thorium is super cheap and we'll pretty much never run out of it. Using the Molten Salt Reactor it would be the safest and one of the cheapest energy sources available. Waste from uranium reactors could be burned in the thorium reactor as well as nuclear weapons. I'd say why even bother with solar and wind and just use thorium, but sadly, people have an irrational fear for nuclear energy. 
My point remains however: Nuclear Energy is required if we want to reduce carbon emissions as close to zero as possible.

t3_2snv4g	CMV: Overpopulation is a serious problem and people have yet to have families should think about having smaller families.	"I think the size of the global human population is too large and that overpopulation is getting worse.

t3_37b3is	CMV:I do not believe in an all knowing/all powerful/all good God.	"I know the same topic has been posted before, but after reading through the comments I still could not find myself convinced.


To quickly summarize the problem I have and for those unfamiliar with the question:

The Christian God is believed to possess omniscience, omnipotence, and benevolence. Assuming this God exists: It would know of all evil, have the power to stop the evil, and being a benevolent being would want to act on this knowledge and eliminate the evil. However, there is evil and so in lies the problem. 


The person who posted this belief before was convinced by the free will answer. Essentially, a world with Human free will and some bad is better than a world without free will. However, I do not find this logic convincing. (Although, I would still like to discuss it as that is the point of this subreddit.) I do not find it convincing because I do not believe that Free Will is necessarily a desired thing, and also, I don't think I believe Free Will exists. (If anyone wishes to discuss this I will explain my beliefs further.)


I would also welcome any other counterpoints beyond that of free will!


Thank you!

t3_30z2m7	CMV: Wasting water is not a big deal if you live in an area with a lot of freshwater.	"I consider myself an environmentally sensible person. I bike or use public transit, avoid wasting electricity, recycle whenever possible, etc. However, when it comes to reducing my water consumption I don't see the point.

I find it hard to sympathize with people who make a fuss about leaving the tap on too long or overwatering the lawn. Its true that water will be the cause of many conflicts in the future, however that is a climate issue. Wasting water now will do nothing to prevent future droughts caused by climate change, especially because my area will be unaffected.

I acknowledge there are some costs to water like:

* Chlorine and chemicals used to disinfect

* Energy used to pump water through treatment plants and city pipes

* Costs to build and expand water treatment plants

* And the costs to treat waste water

However I believe these marginal costs aren't significant enough for me to change my behavior.

I am aware that there are limits to how much water can be drawn from the ground, however the area I'm from gets its drinking water from river's and lakes, so it is effectively limitless.

Lastly, I know the cost of heating water is significant, which is why I'm not using showering, dishwashing, etc as examples. For you to CMV you need to focus on the water itself.

t3_akntp1	"CMV: Green energy isn't worth the investment, and may be more harmful than good."	"Going green is often not green at all. Let's say every company switches to electric trucks (like the one Tesla has). It produces no green house gases, right? So you charge it, and you think, ""hmm, where's the ""green"" energy coming from?"". That would come from oil/coal plants (hydro and nuclear if you're from Canada, won't forget that). 

&#x200B;

So green cars/trucks aren't really green, because they get their energy from ""dirty"" energy sources. 

&#x200B;

So now let's say we decide to change that. Replace \*every\* non-renewable power source with something like wind or solar. Sweet, are we green yet? Not really - where are you going to get the materials to build the wind mills and solar panels? Obviously you're going to have to mine it, and I don't know about you, but last time I checked, there is nothing ""green"" about blowing up and digging out heaps of ground and releasing toxic gases (and greenhouse gases, considering the machines would still be running on fossil fuels). 

&#x200B;

Ok well after we get all these green power sources, are we good then? Still no - the so called ""renewable"" energy sources are not fully renewable. Wind mills and solar panels have to be replaced more often than not. Not only that, but their efficiency is total garbage compared to something like a coal plant, and need \*huge\* open spaces to produce a reasonable amount of power. And how do we get that much open space? By destroying habitats, of course!

&#x200B;

That's the problem - nobody looks further than whats in front of them. They think ""If I replace my gas car with an electric car, I'm not releasing \*any\* green house gases!"" Green energy is just not efficient, cheap, and reliable enough to be a substitute for non-renewable energy sources. 

&#x200B;

What I think we should do is put more hydroelectric stations, and more nuclear (Maybe some of that Thorium...?). Both cause minimal damage to the environment, release minimal pollution, and are very efficient and reliable. "	1	
t3_ezoqci	CMV: Australia Needs to change its stance on Nuclear Energy! this is my reason why	"Australia, Since the 1970s has had a harsh stance on Nuclear energy/weapons due to many variables. But for this post i won't be talking about why but what should be changed/done. 

Australia right now is in an issue where they ban things generally due to the public's concern. They banned Nuke testing in 1970s (good thing that!) but also banned Nuclear power plants according to federal law even though some other sources say it is banned only in Tasmania and Queensland. The funny thing is that the populace also want to stop global warming by fighting against Coal and Oil power but theoretically for environmental and global warming sakes is that you CAN NOT ban both due to Australia's fragile economy and other factors. 

If they removed oil and coal they would either have to go for more Hydro power (which is a problem right now) or Biomass power which by themselves would be hard to adjust to. Renewables are even worse when it comes to energy as you would have to fill whole areas full of wind turbines and/or Solar panels which could damage whole ecosystems. Wind Turbines (according to Thoughty2 YT) kill many species of birds and have one other defect i will mention later. Solar (according to Thoughty2 YT) is expensive and produces lots of Toxic waste that never decays when panels are broken but the biggest disadvantage of them all is ""they only produce energy when the wind is blowing or the sun is shining"" - Thoughty2

This is general proof that if they changed that they will probably be in more trouble than they already are in. Nuclear energy isn't dangerous (when controlled and handled correctly) and has the lowest Carbon emissions by all energy sources and theoretically is the safest and with new tech on the way like meltdown failsafes being proposed we could see a safer future with this stuff!"	1	
t3_2b3tg2	CMV:Budyko's blanket should be implemented	"[Budyko's Blanket] (http://freakonomics.com/2011/09/02/finally-a-garden-hose-to-the-sky/)Is a system outlined by Intellectual Ventures to act as a sort of artificial volcano, pumping Sulfur Dioxide high into the atmosphere to reflect sunlight, much like a volcanic eruption does, but regulated. Since the carbon output is so massive and countries like India and China would take decades to get on board any Carbon reduction program, would it not be a good idea to reverse the course of global warming? It is also cost effective as well, see link. Since we know volcanic eruptions have an  effect on climate change, with sulfur dioxide being the main cause, (it was once used as a refrigerant gas) and such a device is completely controllable. Possible problems: Sulfur Dioxide may be dangerous, but we already pump out billions of tons worth of carbon monoxide every year, and the design of Budyko's blanket prevents most of the problems. Only a few countries would need to do this due to the wind. if you read *SuperFreakonomics* this idea would be known to you, as the idea is explained so much better by the authors.

t3_5yvayl	CMV: Shortages of drinking water in the United States will happen relatively soon	"While the drought in California has recently abated, it certainly won't be the last one.

Climate change will continue to cause worsening extreme weather conditions, including drought.

We're depleting water tables much faster than they can possibly refill.

The dismantling of the EPA could feasibly lead to increased levels of pollution in lakes, rivers, and other water sources.

Water rights are totally fucked and prioritize commercial use over drinking water, and investors are even buying things like almond growing operations simply to get access to the water rights in anticipation of future shortages (thinking of California again here).

In short, we're going to be awfully fucked before too long and some (many?) people are going to have their lives endangered in the USA at some point in the next several decades.

I genuinely hope someone can change my view on this because I think it sounds like a terrible predicament!

t3_29lli6	CMV: There should be a food labeling standard that scores the environmental sustainability of the food.	"Our food systems are becoming increasingly industrialized. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as so-called 'factory farming' can often lead to increased efficiencies. The problem is when the system is not sustainable, and its scale cause the unsustainability to be magnified and affect the environment in seriously negative ways.

The labeling standard should be science-based, using current and established data about pesticides, erosion, water use, and biodiversity. The labels will weight each value, and give a ""sustainability score"" to the foodstuffs. 

A label might have a total score, and then sub-scores with sentences like ""This product was irrigated in a water-scarce area"", or, ""This product uses genetic modification techniques which reduces pesticide use by xx% compared to conventional crops"" or ""This product was farmed organically using no synthetic pesticides"". These are just examples, as they likely have some problems by being an oversimplification or something.

The main problem is determining what exactly sustainability is, how to weigh the different factors, and the cost of doing the research on each farm and food production system. This isn't a simple task, however I believe the advantages informative environmental labeling will create positive pressure to use our most efficient and environmentally sustainable farming technologies.

t3_3i1qfo	"CMV: There is no hope for mankind or this world, life is pointless and all our best efforts are empty, as nature is set up in a way that evil, destruction, and ignorance will always win in the end"	"Basically, I was looking at some YouTube videos from different places, doing some research on the internet, reading political polls, scientific polls, and reading about history and psychology when I finally reached a conclusion. Because of the way the natural world works, destruction, ignorance, and evil, will always win.

Let me start out by saying, philosophically, I'm a cynic, fatalist (not in the spiritual predetermined sense, but more in the sense that the laws of nature predetermine reality), and an existential nihilist. Basically, nothing really matters, this world and especially mankind are hopeless, and despite our best efforts out struggles are ultimately sadly, but surely, futile. 

Why do I say evil and destruction are predetermined to win? One simple fact, destruction is just so much easier than creation. I have some examples:

1. Look at the Twin Towers, they took decades to build, had hundreds of construction workers, planners, managers, and businessmen that went into building them. Upon completion they housed thousands of workers and was a center for economics. Hundreds of workers, decades, and thousands of lives, all of that torn down because one day a couple hijackers with an airplane decided they wanted to hurt our country. In response our country then killed millions of their people. 

2. Next, nearly three years ago now, young children all went to enjoy just a comfortable day at school, they went to spend time with their friends, learn, and go home and tell their parents all about it. Some teachers watched over them. Love, care, money, billions of years of evolution, all of it ended when one day a deranged man decided the best way to make a point was to go to that school and end the lives of those innocent children and the teachers that watched over them.

3. In our modern world, billions of years of evolution and biodiversity are being destroyed because the human race needs more and more. The planet we inhabit is far behind our singular, greedy goal of accumulating power and wealth. And then, rather than accept the hard truths, most humans would rather listen to the politicians that would happily stick a knife into their back. Billions of years of biodiversity, all destroyed within 500 years of industrialization. 

Honestly, in this world, how could goodness, creation, and knowledge possibly win? How could creation and life win if destruction and death is so much easier? How could knowledge and wisdom win if fear always drags people to ignorance? How could good win when the core of a human is entirely selfish? 

My view is simply this, the world will not change, for it *cannot* change. It doesn't matter what happens, the victims will either always remain the same or switch out, destruction will always reign supreme, and fear and ignorance will always lead to one man killing another for his resources rather than working together to cultivate them. 

I implore you to change my bleak views, because, honestly, on a dying planet, as a member of a species that has begun to pride itself on ignorance, where things like race and sexual orientation matter more than survival and cooperation, where a group of friends can spend weeks orchestrating a magnificent picnic only for a maniac with a gun to decide their lives don't matter ending it instantly, I don't know what else to think other than that evil has such a massive advantage over good and will always come out on top."	1	
t3_259a57	CMV: Electing a Republican controlled government in 2016 might be a good thing.	"I was just reading about Americans for Prosperity spending 130 million dollars on the upcoming midterm elections and got to thinking... 

The US is on a downward trajectory in a lot of ways.  Declining purchasing power, increasing unemployment, rising inequality, and erosion of privacy and civil liberties.  Corporate influence reigns supreme.

Now, theoretically, I believe all of these problems could be remedied by a mass political movement working within the confines of the current system--even with only two parties.  It would be slow, yes.  We would need extremely charismatic leaders and an engaged and informed electorate that would maintain interest through multiple elections including midterms.

In practice, however, these problems cannot be solved by the current political system.  Voters have been deceived into supporting the very policies that have lead to our current situation, or they have been convinced that political participation of any kind is pointless.  The few voters that are actually informed on the issues and willing to participate are simply not enough in numbers to accomplish anything.

The current system is unsustainable in the long term.  As wealth continues to accumulate at the top, those at the top will have more political influence.  This will result in even further erosion of the social safety net and fair labor practices, an increase in corporate subsidization, and lower taxes for the wealthy/corporations, thus further accumulating wealth at the top.  This positive feedback loop will continue until the impoverished masses overthrow the current system.

Given the country's downward trajectory and its inability to course correct, collapse is inevitable.  It's only a question of how long.  For the sake of future generations and perhaps even the future of humanity (global warming), it would be better for this collapse to happen as quickly as possible therefore allowing a new, sustainable system to be implemented.  

This brings me back to the upcoming midterm elections and 2016.  Republicans solidly have the house for the foreseeable future thanks to gerrymandering.  As a result, even if Democrats wanted to make substantive changes (which, given the current political landscape they don't--they're only good for championing status quo), they can't.  On the other hand, if Republicans took control of all three, it's hard to imagine how swiftly things would change.  I'd imagine labor laws, the federal minimum wage, and medicaid/medicare/social security as we know would quickly go out the window.  I think things would get really bad really quickly.  The aforementioned mass civil unrest would occur.  Several years of extreme hardship would most likely follow, but in this rock-bottom period there would be hope and opportunity for rebuilding a better society.

**tl;dr**  CMV:  A Republican sweep in 2016 would hasten the inevitable demise of our current political system by creating intolerable conditions for so many Americans that mass civil unrest would undoubtedly follow.  Out of that civil unrest a new, more equitable, and sustainable political system could be implemented."	1	
t3_4l0fgj	CMV: I believe regulating Wall Street is ineffective as banks will always be one step ahead of regulators.	"I'll preface this by saying that I view Wall Street and investment banking with a contempt few professions inspire, for a wide variety of reasons. After the 2008 crisis, my view was that I'd gladly see half of Wall Street in jail and the other half subject to enough regulation to make Dodd-Frank look like a blurb.

Having watched political and economic developments over the last few years, that's still a part of my personal utopia, but I don't think it's an effective solution in practice. It seems to me that Wall Street finds new ways to make profits at the expense of its customers (and, when things go really wrong, taxpayers who bail them out) at a remarkably quick pace.

Congress, by contrast, moves far more slowly. The last major reform was Dodd-Frank, passed in 2010, thanks to a Democratic supermajority in the Senate (which happens once in a blue moon), and the financial industry has been lobbying to water many elements of the law down ever since it was passed. A Republican congress will kill any attempts to pass new regulations, or amend existing ones for better enforcement. Even if we get new laws passed, it'll take a long fight, which financial lobbyists and their congressional allies will drag out as much as they can.

Note that I'm not trying to make this a political issue. In 2008, Obama raised plenty of funds from Wall Street, though the numbers dipped in 2012 because his campaign was more populist. Reagan and Clinton both played a part in deregulation. I'm reasonably convinced that a dollar in lobbying money is worth $1 on either side of the aisle.

Anyway, faced with this trend (banks can make changes overnight, the federal government can take years or decades to pass new laws regulating Wall Street), the logical conclusion seems to be that trying to regulate Wall Street is like a game of whack-a-mole, with a very slow hammer and a very fast mole that periodically changes shape so the hammer is useless.

I suspect there's a lot of information out there that I haven't considered, and I'd be glad to have reliable evidence that my view isn't necessarily correct. So, change my view.

t3_8ye6uz	CMV: Bitcoin (and all other crypto currencies) should be banned due to their environmental impact.	"Crypto currency mining is what powers crypto currencies - It’s what allows them to be what they are. It essentially works by asking miners to solve complex calculations in order to process transactions. The issue here is that the problems are getting harder and harder and therefore require more and more processing power to be solved. Besides the cost of producing hardware to solve these problems massive amount of energy are being spent powering mining farms. 

Energy is expensive to produce in terms of CO2 and environmental impact, and minimising our use of energy while finding better (renewable and clean) sources is essential to sustaining our planet. Cryptomining seeks to actively expend as much energy as possible (energy consumption is a main consideration in mining calculations) for no additional benefit. 

Surely there must be a better way (for our environment) to manage currency. I therefore think that crypto-mining should be banned due to the environmental impact it is having by wasting energy."	1

t3_20uhmf	"I don't believe in free will, CMV"	"Ok so I don't believe in free will. Please change my view, I'm very open to it changing.

People are a product of two things interacting with each other in very complex ways, environment and genetics. Even identical twins can be different genetically as, putting it crudely, genes can be turned on and off by environment and no two people's environments are the same, even with the same upbringing. 

There are no other factors involved in what makes a person. None. 

These two factors are out of our control, we don't choose our genes, and while our choices change our environment, acting in a feedback loop, we don't choose our environment either.

Since we have no control over these two factors, we therefore have no control over who we are and the decisions we decide to make. 

Science keeps on piling up the evidence, a study of neuroscience and psychology in any depth will show you that human behaviour is governed by genetics and the environment interacting in complex ways. 

Therefore I think the concept of *deserving* reward or punishment is redundant. Please note that I'm not saying reward and punishment aren't useful in modifying behaviour, just that it isn't deserved. 

Just because we don't live in a deterministic mechanical world doesn't mean that cause and effect don't still apply. 

And I'm well aware that humans have a 'will', and make choices and decisions, I'm just saying that this will isn't free.

There's a lot more to my view but I'll elaborate in response to posts.

t3_3728n9	"CMV: Despite the temporary economic benefits of development, job creation, and industry, the disruption and destruction of natural habitats for mining and industrial purposes is not acceptable and should be strongly limited by the federal government."	"The argument for supporting development of natural ecosystems is usually to help feed and grow a nation's economy.  Potential to help increase the US oil and gold supply can lead to the mining of certain areas that are important ecosystems for wild animals.  Lawmakers and companies claim that this will create jobs and help improve the regional economy of an area, but all this does is cause more development and destruction of natural habitats, which leads to more people living there, and more and more development.
Climate change has already adversely affected many regions, causing desertification of some areas once ripe with vegetation and the warming of colder climate areas.  It seems that human beings just continue to expand and expand in order to create industry, to feed the economy, only to expand further into natural areas.  
I understand that nowadays many mining companies or major industries will help rehabilitate other areas to make up for the areas that they develop, but that doesn't make up for causing the extinction or immigration of mass populations of animals. Many mining operations are temporary, and once the ore or oil is completely drawn out the industry will leave but it will have permanently harmed the natural inhabitants of the area.  

What compelling reasoning is there behind constantly destroying natural ecosystems around the world?  Obviously it's terrible to destroy some of the precious ecosystems that make this world so beautiful, but people keep using the argument that jobs can be created and economic growth can increase in once uninhabited regions.  I think it is unacceptable to even think that something good can come from destroying natural habitats to mine or transport oil, when the use of oil as fuel is (pretty much ) already having adverse affects around the world.

It just seems to me that the argument that the development of natural ecosystems for job creation and industrial development has no endgame, and that it just perpetuates the destruction of the many natural areas around the world that have (fortunately) not been harmed by humans. Or is it just too late at this point to save the world?

Please change my view. I think it is unacceptable that lawmakers continue to allow the permanent destruction of natural habitats for temporary economic development.

t3_4ntnxw	"CMV: There are three possible scenarios when it comes to consuming animals for food, each with radically different moral implications."	"They say meat is murder, but what do we say to the actions of wild animals who behave according to nature? Do we feed our pets a vegan diet though they are biologically incompatible with one? As naturally omnivorous animals it is in our nature to consume meat, but we can survive without it. 

Here I will put forward a model which I believe reconciles these contradictions. Three scenarios which ultimately shall be judged three different ways. 

First, the hunter-gatherer society. Say that this particular group were particularly well-to-do. They had a strong culture and views. There was discussion about the value of animal life. Though hunting was a major source of food, many questioned whether it was right to take the lives of animals when the tribe could survive without meat. The population size of this fictional tribe was low enough that wild animal populations were able to outsustain the level of hunting.

Second, the modern fishing industry. This industry harvests wild fish from the ocean. When apex predator fish go extinct or become too scarce, fishing goes after the next biggest fish, and so on. This group has a tendency to wipe out entire populations of wild fish, slowing only when faced with regulation. 

Finally, livestock farming. The major source of animal products in our society, farming creates lives that have one destiny: slaughter. Many animals are kept in extremely cruel conditions. Whether egg laying or milk producing, all livestock must face the abattoir at the end of their short lives. Male chicks are liquefied upon hatching, to be ground up into feed for hens. The practice of feeding deceased cattle and sheep to members of their own species led to the emergence of prion diseases. 

I would argue that eating meat from any of these industries (sustainable hunting, unsustainable hunting, livestock farming) have respectively different moral outcomes, though the result to the consumer is the same. In each of these scenarios, someone who chooses to eat meat could do without it, even in the affluent hunter-gatherer society.

What makes them different is the effects on the animal populations. In the hunter-gatherer society, humans are just another predator. Animal lives are natural, cut short by various natural ills. It makes no sense to decry the natural order if a better option is not available. In modern times hunting can have the benefit of culling herbivore populations that would otherwise grow too large in the absence of natural predators So I would say that sustainable hunting cannot be immoral as it is no worse than natural predation and often makes up for it in current predator deprived times.

In the case of unsustainable hunting, exemplified by the current fishing industry, animal lives are not too different. Many shorter lived fish species live long enough to reproduce, in the same wild ocean of their ancestors. When the net comes down, they die in a way no worse than natural predation. Longer lived species like tuna often dont live long enough to reproduce, leading to population decline and inevitable extinction. While population trends near the end of the 20th century suggested mass extinction, marine reserves have done work to reverse decline. Still, many species still appear doomed under the current scheme. It is clear a crime is being committed here, but that crime cannot be cruelty as for the most part fish and other animals live natural lives, unaware they are the last of their kind. 

Livestock farming seems problematic even compared to unsustainable hunting. Animals are kept in varying conditions, but all too often in abject cruelty. In fact the scale of cruelty in agriculture in modern times probably dwarfs all the suffering humans have ever inflicted on themselves. Furthermore, the fact that food animals never have a chance to escape like they do in the wild makes this even worse as their lives have one purpose only, and it is not their purpose.  Livestock farming is a monstrosity that does not end with the extinction of species but instead grows in a perpetual cycle of cruelty, breeding animals that are grotesque imitations of their wild ancestors. 

So to sum up, small scale hunting is natural and acceptable; unsustainable hunting like in the fishing industry leads to extinction which is a tragedy, but is not especially cruel; while livestock farming is a terrifying monstrosity which should never have been allowed to happen.

t3_pb0nfo	CMV: The Paris Climate Accord will result in more pollution.	"Trump pulled the United States out of the accord, because it was bad for business I believe he said. I am not arguing this from an economic standpoint. My point is that allowing China & India to produce CO2 with impunity will just cause USA to buy their products from them, where they will be made with fewer environmental regulations (and less fair wages) and then shipped over to The United States. I see it as something that will merely make people feel good but not actually help the planet any. Just use China & India as a sort of whipping boy to produce all the carbon they want for years. They are on the same planet as we are, it isn't like having China emit carbon will help our climate.

t3_3lvgyr	CMV: Technology progress is slowing down and stagnating	"Basically i think that our progress in technology is basically slowing down. When the Industrial Revolution happened, there was ton of progress. This went on throughout the late 19th and first half of the 20th century. Compare the year 1900 to the year 1950: there were tons of differences because of technology. Cars, airplanes, submarines, tanks, radar, telephones, radio, television, x-rays, antibiotics, nuclear energy, and tons more. It was a completely different world. Then compare 1950 to 2000, and the differences are much less impressive. The only big changes were in computers and communication technology. Those were huge deals that changed the world, but not as much as all the changes that happened in the 1900-1950 interval.

You can also break the 1950-2000 interval up into smaller intervals, and see that even less has changed as time went on. The 60s, 70s, and 80s saw the most change as computers got smaller, but things seemed to slow down in the 90s and 00s. The 2000s are basically the 90s but with internet and cellphones. Now we're halfway through the 2010s and it feels like nothing has changed in a decade. Since 2005 we got iPhones and that's literally about it. No big medical breakthroughs, no big breakthroughs in energy or physics, nothing that actually has a tangible effect on people's lives.

However in my state about 66% of electricity on the grid comes from coal.   Coal plants have little to no emissions controls.  If I plug my car in to the grid, I am trading well controlled emissions for poorly controlled emissions, doing more harm overall.   

The batteries are made with nickle and cobalt.    These are mined in open pits and do a ton of damaged to the environment.    Cobalt is often mined by child and slave labor.  

Then, a standard gas car will last 300k to 400k miles with basic repair and likely no engine rebuilds.   But an electric car is likely to need new batteries every 100k miles.  

That is why I think Electric Cars are actually worse for the environment at this current time.   

Change my view.   "	1	
t3_1fo8qn	I believe that the modern GOP is only concerned about the short-term prosperity and viability of America.	"For example, their economic and fiscal policy seems to be about maximizing profits in the present without regards to the cost of doing business like this a decade down the road. In terms of environmental and safety regulations, they want to nix these so that the economy isn't bogged down by them in the present despite that fact that the future consequences of doing so will most likely be detrimental.

t3_e0rurs	"CMV: we are not going to reach half ghg emissions by 2030, and definitely not zero emissions by 2050. We should focus more on how to genetically engineer our crops and other ventures that can help us adjust to the inevitable 8.5 scenario we are going to head to."	"I honestly don’t believe that we are going to even come close to half emissions reduction in the next decade.  With the rise of people becoming leaders who are anti-science/environment/intellectualism like in the US, Australia, and Brazil, it’s just a losing battle that has no shot of winning.  

Every new innovation that is treated like a silver bullet for removing ghgs is inevitably shut down because it can’t be mass produced cheaply and the laws of thermodynamics don’t help either.

Instead we need to focus on how we can maintain the quality of soil and genetically engineer crops to be able to withstand the inevitable heat increase and lack of water.  That being said, we should also be researching into how we can protect our cities from inevitable rising water levels.  Areas like the Florida keys and New Orleans are going to be underwater unless we build infrastructure to protect the city (yes building walls).  

The reason that we won’t reduce emissions is that in order to do so, not only do we need to remove ghgs from the air, we need to stop ALL activities that have a carbon footprint (which is literally almost every business).  This won’t happen because doing so will obliterate economies (the fear of the governments that enacting a green new deal/carbon tax (if it has tax, it won’t be passed). 

So in short, trying to build technologies to remove emissions, convincing governments to enact a green new deal, and/or stopping all economic growth because all of our businesses have a carbon footprint is a waste of time.  We must instead invest money into genetically engineering crops to withstand all types of weathers and build more infrastructure to withstand sea level rises.  I’d also like to see more desalinization plants built too if we lose access to fresh water."	1	
t3_2l4aiq	CMV: North America should get of foreign oil and be energy independent.	"Much of my discussion comes from the following Ted Talk: *http://www.ted.com/talks/t_boone_pickens_let_s_transform_energy_with_natural_gas 
The sources of energy I will be discussing are oil and natural gas.
Oil is the backbone of the American economy. I remember a teacher saying the American economy was built on the availability of cheap oil. However, I  think oil will eventually phase out. It is just too destructive to the environment and costs too much. In the meantime, let's get off foreign oil from OPEC, and just import from Canada and Mexico, and drill it ourselves. Here we can get out of the mess we created in the Middle East, and not pay for someone else's oil, when North America has the proven reserves. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_proven_oil_reserves

As Boone Pickens mentions in his talk, Natural Gas can do basically everything Oil can, and burns 30 percent cleaner than Oil. This will help settle the environmentalists. Also Natural Gas is much cheaper than oil, and is more abundant in North America. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_natural_gas_proven_reserves
Now I am all for renewable energy, but until it is cost-effective, it will not succeed. Pickens mentions this in his talk that natural gas is a bridge fuel to Nuclear, Solar, Hydro, Thermal, Wind etc.

So users of CMV, tell me why North America should not be energy independent and still use foreign oil."	1	
t3_4vy9bb	CMV: I believe social interactions are overrated and a person could live just fine seeing people once a year or once in a decade or only when they go get their supplies.	"So, everywhere I see studies talking about the dangers of isolation and I think that is not fair to all the people of the world. Many people could live just fine alone for years without any social interaction, since you'll meet people anyway when you go buy groceries and utilities in the supermarket for example. I see studies linking social isolation to depression and I know that I for one would never be depressed because I see no other human in front of me. I remain unconvinced that all the humans on this planet need social interaction. There are many people that don't, maybe the majority, but not all people."	1	
t3_8i9kdw	CMV: California's new solar requirement is stupid	"Starting in 2020, California will require all new homes to have solar panels. https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/business/energy-environment/california-solar-power.html
I agree with California's motives, (slowing climate change), but this policy is the wrong way to go about it.  First, not every home is ideal for solar power.  Some are heavily shaded, and others may not have an ideal south-facing roof surface.  Second, energy may be more efficiently produced in large scale solar farms, or even in a different technology like wind.  Mandating that every home have solar panels is not a cost-effective way to produce energy, since there are more efficient alternatives.  

A better solution is to simply implement a carbon tax, such that the increased price of fossil fuel energy will naturally lead to transition towards renewables, sans the inefficiencies.

Any way I can imagine for this to change leads to a dead end; either the people in power are too powerful to be overthrown or even if they are, there will be a vicious circle of overthrowing the old status quo and replacing it with a new, promising one that ends up being consumed by power too. I feel weak, I feel powerless and at times the only hope I seem to get for living in a good world is building my own spaceship and venturing to some other planet, but that requires money, and to get money, you have to be like them...

t3_ba6lyd	"CMV: In the wild, removing invasive plants is a waste of time and energy."	"Before you say, ""This never happens!  Nobody wastes their time pulling up invasive plants!""  Dude, yeah they do.  Especially in Spring in the northern hemisphere.  (I've changed the titles of some articles to be more descriptive of what they are about, relevant to this discussion.)

[Hawaii Burning Massive Invasive Mangrove Trees](https://earther.gizmodo.com/why-hawaii-is-burning-its-massive-mangrove-trees-1828746100)

[Chesapeake Invasive Species Removal](https://www.chesapeakebay.net/news/blog/photo_of_the_week_protecting_a_wetland_from_invasive_species)

[Invasive Plants are Everywhere](https://www.invasive.org/species.cfm)

&#x200B;

First off, I want everyone to ask, ""Invasive as of when?""  Not just because humans are an invasive species, but because certain plants have been accepted as native (such as the Cherokee Rose) simply because they've been in an environment long enough that people don't think of them as being foreign anymore.  

&#x200B;

Second, the argument that I see the most often is that invasive plants crowd out native plants and thus starve native species that for some reason can't eat non-native plants and thrive.  And, yeah, there are some plants that just aren't helpful for abundant wildlife, but whether they are native or non-native isn't really related to how much they can help wildlife.  There might be native plants in the space once the invasive plants are removed or it could just stay barren ground.  It's better to have plants than not have plants, so pulling up invasive plants is destructive and wasteful.

&#x200B;

A better argument is that non-native plants host and feed invasive animals that destroy the environment.  Again, invasive animals (and insects, and fungi) don't specifically need to feed off of non-native plants.  If they did, their presence wouldn't be a problem but they feed off of native plants that have no defenses against them.  This is called evolution and we can't stop it from happening.  Destroying real plants to get at hypothetical animals is rubbish and a waste of time.  It's ineffective, it won't work.

&#x200B;

Destroying non-native plants and preaching to ""Plant Native!"" is just a feel-good measure for people who want to do something for the environment but don't want to pick up trash,. (Picking up trash would be a better use of time and energy, but has social stigma, I guess.)  Foreign plants are just as good at feeding wildlife (except koalas) as native plants, and tearing through the underbrush and setting things on fire is a silly, silly way to try to help the environment.

&#x200B;

I know that this can't be true for all ecosystems everywhere.  TBH I'm not wedded to this view but the argument has been building in my mind for years.  I'm tired of hearing people say that the nectar from butterfly bushes is like cocaine for butterflies, or that mulberry bushes are awful because they're ""trash trees"" and not because birds poop purple everywhere, or that all Trees of Heaven should be destroyed because they're foreign when they're clearly important for stopping erosion on the side of the road and in other places where nothing else has had a chance to colonize the mud.  And when the oceans are rising and mangroves are really important for protecting the coastline, going out into the jungle to remove the Asian mangroves from the American mangroves, seems insane to me.

t3_2tn8qu	CMV: The majority of the world's international issues could be curbed or solved by population control.	"Okay, so I have had this theory building up over the last ten years or so as I have been going through school and getting degrees in different areas. I can go to school for free and I like to learn. I've studied history, ecology, politics, health and public safety, art and psychology. I'm by no means an expert in any of them but I'm well-versed enough to talk about all of them.

I've seen a trend that in every field, the general stressor or causal issue in each is overpopulation. The exponential growth of the human race causes structural failure in on a local, regional, national and global scale. The only way to begin the trend back towards a sustainable global environment is for people to just stop having children.

Below are the top five global issues listed as worries for Europeans from a poll taken in 2011. I couldn't find an updated one for the US that I trusted. With them I've laid out the **very very very light** framework of how population control could benefit. No deep details, just an overview of my opinion.

**Global Warming/Ecological Impact:** Love it or hate it, humans take a major toll on natural resources without heeding the impact it takes on the earth as a complete system. If there was a concerted effort to keep the population from growing for even a decade, or indefinitely limiting the number of offspring allowed to be born, it would curb the toll taken on natural resources as well as lessen the footprint we're leaving as a species. On top of that, the industrial complex that is needed to support a growing population must continually make riskier and riskier decisions on how to keep they supply meeting demand. This means rather than dumping their waste in a safe place, it's going to rivers and oceans so that they can keep production up. Rather than finding sustainable ways to transport goods, their profits are going toward scaling the business rather than researching sustainability.  

**War:** I could go on and on about this one but here's the finer points. Since the beginning of man, war has been over one thing: **resources**. Every good politician finds a way to make war about something else; be it justice, national security or what have you. But in the end it's resources. Iraq=Oil. Civil War=Cheap Slave Labor. Iraq invading Kuwait=Oil. WWII=Iron, Oil and Land. Point being, if there was a lowered strain on the global market to provide enough supply to meet a burgeoning demand, there would be less need for conflict. Additionally, if there were lower populations in countries struggling to stay afloat, it would take less resources to stabilize the economy.

**Global Energy Crisis/Food Shortage:** See above entry on War. 

**Epidemic Disease:** With a growing population and a limited amount of space, the chances of falling prey to an epidemic disease grow daily just based upon the fact that as the continue to grow the space between each human continues to decrease. Mathematically, there will come a time when humans will grow in number to a point that we are literally living on top of each other and spreading disease will become inevitable. Look at lower income areas of many large Asian cities: people are just stacked upon each other. Population control would move that trend in the opposite direction. As the elderly die off and fewer newborn children are introduced into the world, the space per human would continue to grow. 

**Psychological Issues:** Overpopulation is a psychological stressor. The idea that everyday there are hundreds or thousands of young people entering the workforce who are vying for your job, waiting for you to retire or die so that they can take your place causes stress. Same goes for your food, your home or your spouse or partner. You don't have to be a PhD to realize that every day there are more people vying for the same resources you require to survive. You see it when you fill up your car, or wait in line at the grocery store or watch the news and see reporting on wars fought over land or oil. In the back of your mind, you can't help but imagine a world where someone is coming to take your shit by force. That's a stressor. On a daily basis it's probably not going to affect you much, but add that effect up over years or decades and it's a BIG worry. Every time you hear about a junkie looking for a fix committing a burglary, you're not thinking that some poor guy got his shit stolen. You're thinking ""That could be me. Someone could be coming for my shit next."" *The majority of crimes in America are property crimes. Because there are limited resources that people want and a growing number of people.*

What you'll notice about every single one of these issues comes down to one thing: resources. Be it land, space, food, healthcare, there's only so much of each commodity left on this planet and a growing need to distribute it to more people. Mathematically, we cannot sustain growth like this for more than a generation or two. If we don't run out of resources first, we'll end up killing everyone for the ones that are left. 

And last but not least, I'd like to point out the futility of my own viewpoint here. Politics will not ever allow for measures to be put into place that would enforce something like what I'm proposing. American politicians refuse to touch this topic with a ten foot pole because their goal is to stay in office as long as possible and telling people to stop fucking is not the way to do that. Factor in the bible thumping campaign donors and it's all over. Even if there was legislation passed tomorrow, it would take a generation to even notice the difference. Then factor in the economic shock of changing from an economy driven by consumption to one that only produces what's needed and we're looking at a global depression. 

And that's all I have to say about that.

No matter what changes we make, it has already been calculated that by 2050 (even if we stop CO2 emissions TODAY) coral reefs as we know it will be gone. I get that understanding them will help us preserve our fisheries for the moment, but what about after? No matter what plan is implemented, its too late.

t3_bjqlw7	CMV: We need to open up a geothermal power plant near Yellowstone	"A lot of the debate when it comes to how the United States can bring down emissions from electricity generation centers around renewables, energy storage, and nuclear. Every possible solution comes with several pronounced drawbacks. Solar and wind are intermittent sources of energy, batteries are expensive, and nuclear is expensive + there are unsolved challenges when it comes to long-term storage of waste in the US.  While I agree that a silver bullet does not exist, I think the following proposal is a no-brainer.

&#x200B;

We should repeal the Geothermal Steam Act of 1970 and build a geothermal energy plant at Yellowstone. If this sounds crazy, it shouldn't be. Scientists at NASA think that extracting energy from Yellowstone's geothermal resources is the only way we can prevent a massive volcanic eruption in the future.

""So in 2017, NASA scientists ran a thought experiment to see if they might be able to halt a future supereruption. The internal study led by [Brian Wilcox](https://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/people/Brian_Wilcox/), an engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, suggested drilling a series of wells around the perimeter of the park and pumping cold water down into the hot rock. The hypothetical solution would [cool down Yellowstone’s magma chamber](https://scienceandtechnology.jpl.nasa.gov/possible-ways-defend-civilization-supervolcanic-eruptions) and prevent calamity.""

""As a bonus, the system would be able to extract five gigawatts of electricity, making it one of the largest power plants in the world. Outside experts agree that Yellowstone hosts enough [geothermal energy](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/geothermal-energy/) to power the entire country.""

On the extreme end, Forbes says Yellowstone's supervolcano could ""power the entire planet twice over.""

t3_pa4e3h	"CMV: Reducing your carbon footprint is useful and good, but ultimately not sufficient or strictly necessary."	"I've been reading up on combatting climate change recently and kind of came to the conclusion that reducing my carbon footprint through the typical ""green"" things - like going vegetarian, switching to an EV, switching to renewable power, etc. - is a very good thing and something people *should* do (ideally), but that at the end of the day it will never be sufficient to effectively combat climate change (assuming you are a first-world citizen who has to drive around and has to interact with things like like technology or infrastructure on a regular basis.)

I believe that carbon sequestration (any activity that directly captures carbon from the air) is the only way we can effectively achieve true carbon neutrality or negativity. There are services that (claim to) do this for you, where you can pay $X.xx to ""negate"" your carbon footprint*. I think such initiatives being adopted by governments and corporations are the only way to effectively combat climate change until (if) technology enables us to live efficiently enough to where our pre-mitigation carbon footprint is negligible.

t3_27ebnu	CMV: I think it's silly to single out and blame Baby Boomers as a generation for all of society's ills.	"According to subreddits like /r/lostgeneration, the Baby Boomer generation is to blame for many things: the decline of unions, wages, benefits, and working conditions. The rise of tuition costs. On the flipside, they tend to Lionize the so-called ""greatest generation"" as if they had somehow set up a utopian society in the 1950's (which was really only utopian for White, Anglo-Saxon, Protestant men and pretty shitty for everybody else) and the Baby Boomers screwed it all up.

I think this rage is misplaced.

The generation known as the ""baby boomers"" are generally considered to be those who were born in a span of 20 years from 1945 (the end of World War II) to 1965 (the introduction of the oral contraceptive, i.e. ""the pill""). So, basically, today's 49-69-year-olds.

The majority of anti-baby-boomer rage is directed at Ronald Reagan, despite the fact that he was born in 1911 and thus nowhere near qualified to be considered a ""baby boomer"". His Vice-President, George H.W. Bush, was born in 1924. Given that most of congress is made up by those of advanced age, I fail to see how anyone can make the argument that the baby boomers had any kind of policy-making power in the 80's. None of the policies Reagan introduced can therefore possibly be blamed on the Baby Boomer generation.

We have only had three Boomer Presidents: Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama. Though Bush's policies are often cited as examples of Boomer excess, nothing he did was really unique to his generation. And there are just as many Boomer politicians on the other side wanting a restoration of certain policies and laws.

I think what we're really seeing is a generational gap in which the world my generation (the millenials) is experiencing is not the same world our parents (the Boomers) experienced. The problem is that many Boomers are still under the assumption that the world still operates the way it did up until the 70's and 80's. That's where the disconnect and frustration comes, because the set of instructions the Boomers gave us for life was written for a different world.

But are the Boomers really responsible for changing that world? I say no. No because the world always changes. World War II destroyed the world's manufacturing base, leaving the US as largely the lone supplier of goods to the world. This made us very, very rich and prosperous. As other country's rebuilt their industries, we began to have more competition. More specifically, the Japanese caught us with our pants down by implementing the production methods honed by Gilbreth, Taylor, and others and eventually surpassing our quality. Additionally, automation has limited the need for manual labor jobs, causing a shift in the requirements for education. 

All of these things would likely have happened with or without the Baby Boomers, and if they need to be blamed for anything, it's probably holding their children up to the same standard despite not realizing their children don't have the tools to live the same life they did."	1	
t3_1ydmz4	"I believe that a true 'one world government' or 'one planet, one nation' scenario is impossible without some kind of arbitrary external motivator. CMV"	"It's a popular topic for science-fiction (the Federation in Star Trek), as a conspiracy theory (the Illuminati/Freemasons trying to control the world), or as an ideal espoused by certain political or cultural groups (the age of imperialism, the Nazis), but I don't see how the human race would ever decide to voluntary unite as a global nation (meaning unified government and acceptance of our shared commonalities over our differences), mainly because it would eliminate the 'us versus them' motivation that has, in my opinion, pushed the human race (and now certain developed nations) to the position of dominance they now enjoy today. Why change?

In short, there's no motivation for nations to come together unless there is something to come together *against*. What would this something be?

Perhaps climate change could motivate this via humans versus nature, though I think if climate change became a huge problem today the USA and allies would just force the rest of the world into whatever changes were need to combat it while otherwise retaining the status quo. The next best thing I can think of is contact with extraterrestrials (the ultimate in us versus them), but at that point I might as well go watch Kirk and Spock tussle with some Klingons.

t3_8j2p9t	CMV: The current world population growth cannot be sustained	"Just 30 years ago we were with a ""mere"" 5.3 billion people on this earth. In 2011-2012 the total world population reached a whopping 7 billion people earth and by now, just 6 years later, we are already with 7,6 billion people.

I believe this rate of growth cannot be sustained (for much longer). This is because overpopulation is already a problem in countries like China and India. All those people have to be fed and need to drink, but there is only a limited amount of fresh water and food available to us. There are already a lot of problems concerning food and drinkwater in countries (e.g. South Africa) and I don't see these problems being solved anytime soon. The population keeps growing, but the food industry (and water industry, if such a thing exists) cannot follow this rapid growth. 

I think the government should be involved by trying to control the population like China did, some kind of one-child policy. I'm not even sure this would help that much but the way it is now, these problems will also spread to more developed countries. Before we know it there could be a worldwide water scarcity, just because there isn't enough for all of us.

t3_k09y5z	CMV: Liberalism will prevail until the end of time	"I believe that we reached the peak of human existence, and that movement towards socialism will be bound to fail as long as we're human. By ""human"" I mean someone who values equality and prosperity for everybody, and yet at the same time sees the world through a system of value and believes that competition is a valid form of interaction. 

Attempts to move towards socialism (on a large scale, such as nationwide) will always get shut down by the C.I.A. and a majority of the population that is unhappy with how the government (or the people in power) are further left than they are. Most people wants to be left alone and doesn't like radical changes that destabilizes the society and the life in which they live, and without any form of eugenics that attempts to produce the most selfless people or an authoritarian government that will eventually be destroyed by its citizen, it is impossible to keep people satisfied or tacit in a socialist economy.

t3_292lrz	CMV: Why should I care whether rhinos go extinct?	"I think I'll make a throwaway for this one, since this topic is enough to ruin one's career in the wrong circumstance.

Why is it the job of humans to preserve all animals? These animals have died out. What if they would have died out even if humans hadn't existed? There's no way to know, and it's impossible to rule out that possibility. So now we're expected to be the saviors of animals whose very existence may have still been in question regardless of human interaction.

Yes, we have hunted them. And, sure, for the sake of argument, let's allow the possibility that this may have contributed to their eventual extinction. Now, would someone please write a level-headed response about why it's important to care whether they go extinct? Please try to make the argument free of emotional appeals and as thoughtful as possible, and I guarantee you I'll listen. And I'm sure there are other lurkers like me, who are afraid to speak in a social climate like this, who will listen too.

I'm interested in possibly being sympathetic to their plight, but it's difficult when no one seems interested in explaining why it's important other than to say, ""We caused it, so therefore of course we should fix it.""

Additionally, the fact that it's heretical of me to even suggest that there are more important things to worry about is evidence to me that this is another one of society's ""crazes"".  For example, it was once considered normal and sensible to burn witches, and anyone who dared suggest that it was perhaps not sensible to burn witches was looked upon with scorn.  Whenever I try to bring this topic up, I get a very similar feeling of, ""You don't already feel the same way we feel?  There must be something inherently wrong with you.""

So, I'll come to /r/changemyview as my last source of hope that someone will finally make a convincing case (to reiterate, an argument which is *free of emotional appeals*) about why anyone should care whether rhinos go extinct.

I was tempted to increase the scope from ""rhinos"" to ""any animal that doesn't matter very much,"" but then we'd have a debate with endless special cases like, ""You'd care about whether a cow goes extinct, since you drink milk!""  Well, yes, but rhinos don't seem to matter nearly as much as cows do.

I'm aware that this is inherently a selfish viewpoint.  I hope you will treat it with some minimum level of courtesy and realize that this is why I'm coming to /r/changemyview: to have my view changed.  Insults won't, so can we skip them?

t3_hhsxpx	"CMV: The radical changes to monuments, displays, and other cultural outlets will do much more harm than good in the long run."	"I should clarify at the start that I think glorifying historical figures who took part in great injustices such as slavery is absolutely wrong.  In order to change my view here, I'll need someone to provide solid reasoning why the changes described below won't harm society as I fear it will.

Statues have already been toppled.  Those of objectionable figures that haven't been removed are subject to public calls for relevant governments to remove them.  Universities and other institutions are changing, or considering changing, the names of buildings honoring certain people with questionable histories.  And it seems the majority of people - certainly the majority of activists - agree with the direction this is heading.

Tangentially, there's also the matter of museums being called to account for display items with questionable or even provably criminal provenance. While I do believe any items not donated by the peoples themselves should be immediately returned, I can't say I'm thrilled at the idea of removing mention of those things entirely.

The US as a country, and humanity in general, has a well-established history of sweeping unpleasantness under the rug.  We go around and around with calls for change and scandals surrounding poor treatment of certain demographics.  Things might improve for a short while, but we always end up right back where we started.

People are calling for radical changes now, including as summarized above, but I think those are the wrong radical changes to make.  As much as I hate to give credit to the ""but you're erasing history"" crowd, I have to admit they're on to something here.  **Those who forget history are doomed to repeat it.**

Simply stopping honoring people who participated in atrocities and injustices isn't going to get us anywhere.  Without indicators around to remind us what they did, horrible though it was, *we are going to do it again.*  And again.  And again.

The radical change we need to see isn't removal.  We don't need to wipe these names and sculptures and references from our daily lives.  We need to change the script.  We need to leave them up and fully own the history behind them.  Use them as teaching tools for future generations.

*""That statue is of a man who sold slaves.  That means he kidnapped people, ripped them from their homes, and took money from other people to force them into free labor.  Let's talk about why that's wrong, and then let's talk about why it was so wrong for this society to glorify him for hundreds of years before it came to its senses.""*

This is the only way we'll learn.  Tearing it all down will only help us forget.  Again.  And repeat it.  Again.

Please.  Change my view."	1	
t3_4arii5	CMV: Humans are overpopulating the planet and needs to be cut down massively.	"NOTE: All of my sources are at the bottom of my post

The current human population is 7,409,032,688 at the time i'm writing this, the human population projected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050 according to the U.N 
 The current rate of growth is unsustainable and will only continue to lead to more chaos, war, poverty, starvation.  I think this provides some  clear context of the problem.  ""Some 1.1 billion people in developing countries have inadequate access to water, and 2.6 billion lack basic sanitation.
Almost two in three people lacking access to clean water survive on less than $2 a day, with one in three living on less than $1 a day.
More than 660 million people without sanitation live on less than $2 a day, and more than 385 million on less than $1 a day."" 
If over a billion people are currently cant even get water how are we supposed to provide for the new 2.7 billion people born in the next 44 years?  All these new people aren't going to be born in the rich parts of the world either,  there going to be born into impoverished areas like Africa.  Africa's population is expected to double by 2050 to 2.4 billion with the poorest African countries seeing the biggest increase in births.  
 Since we are going to have a bigger population we are obviously going to need more food, and i think this sums it up perfectly ""Many scientists think Earth has a maximum carrying capacity of 9 billion to 10 billion people.

One such scientist, the eminent Harvard University sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson, bases his estimate on calculations of the Earth's available resources. As Wilson pointed out in his book ""The Future of Life"" (Knopf, 2002), ""The constraints of the biosphere are fixed.""

Aside from the limited availability of freshwater, there are indeed constraints on the amount of food that Earth can produce, just as Malthus argued more than 200 years ago. Even in the case of maximum efficiency, in which all the grains grown are dedicated to feeding humans (instead of livestock, which is an inefficient way to convert plant energy into food energy), there's still a limit to how far the available quantities can stretch. ""If everyone agreed to become vegetarian, leaving little or nothing for livestock, the present 1.4 billion hectares of arable land (3.5 billion acres) would support about 10 billion people,""  The chance that everyone agrees to equally share the food and give up on meat, i think is so slim its better to not even argue about. So if the scientist is correct there will be no way to be able to feed everyone and it will create massive hardships and plenties of wars will start over food and resources. 
With a increased human population we will need more room to live which means cutting down more trees, destroying more habitats, more dams, which in return will have a devastating effect on humans. More humans means more trash, which we all know means, more trash in our oceans which our sea foods will eat. So with all of the trash in our oceans that means fish populations will be decreased so there will be less seafood as it is and then the seafood we do catch will probably have eaten tiny trash particles that you will end up digesting which might lead to health problems.  Its just not the ocean we have to worry about, new cities will need to be built to accommodate everyone, which will mean less and less fertile soil to grow food on. You cant just keep using the same soil year after year so that will cause even more food shortages, which will lead to violence and wide spread panic. If you care about the wild like i do, then you will be upset to learn that more and more of it will disappear in order to build new cities, and for agriculture. 
As we all know we have a finite amount of natural resources, and they will be increasingly hard to find with a bigger population using more and more of them.  So i would expect everyday things like your phone, computer, watch, to rise in price exponentially. Then lets not forget about the almighty barrel of oil, which will have plenty of countries fighting over  until the last drop.

t3_288dqg	CMV: All recyclable goods and containers should all have a refundable 'deposit' attached to their cost.	"Where I live, I can recycle cardboard, aluminum, and tin along with my regular trash pickup. The cost of having a separate trash can for recyclables is mandatory and included with my city water/sewer/trash bill. 

However, my city does not recycle glass, nor did the city where I lived previously. When I've questioned city officials about this, the answer has always been the same: it's not economically-viable to recycle glass. 

I think an easy solution to this problem would be to do what many cities nationwide have done: attach a 'deposit' surcharge to every can, bottle, and recyclable container - refundable on recycling. 

Obviously, many people would choose not to recycle: their deposits would fund the cost of reprocessing and recycling the materials of those who do. People could still choose to have their recyclables picked up by waste management, and they would get a credit on their trash bill based on the weight of their recycle can. But for a full refund, consumers would have to take their recyclables to a processing center. I remember, when I was growing up in S. California, we would take our cans and bottles to a recycling center and crush them for nickels. I think providing a financial incentive to recycle would cause more of the behavior, and those who choose (for whatever reason) not to participate would subsidize those who do. 

I already pay for garbage and recycling, I pay when I take items to the dump: I don't see why it doesn't make sense to charge people a premium on recyclable materials and grant a refund to those who choose to recycle. I really don't see any downside to this system.

t3_ho7ryf	CMV: everyone lives their lives by trying to maximise their own 'discounted expected future utility'.	"To put in another way, every action is done with the consideration of whether such an action would provide some additional level of utility to that person, either at present or in the future. It's discounted, as some actions are done knowing that they provide future utility, e.g. exercising (some level of suffering) now for future higher levels of utility (better health, shape, confidence etc). It's expected, as future events are not completely known.

One counter might be that many stupid actions are done all the time, e.g. getting addicted on drugs, thus leading to destruction of a person's future for a short stint of happiness. That person, however, at that point in time when he's getting drugged up, or right before doing such an action, either 1) considers that the utility from this action overrides any possible future disutility (bad sleep, or whatnot), or 2) fails to consider enough the range of possible future disutility (possibility of getting into jail).

In this example, that person is still operating under his own discounted expected future utility. He simply failed to ""expect"" properly, so to speak. Nonetheless, the idea still applies.

t3_6g4uy7	"CMV: Unless China and other developed nations adhere to the same (or very similar) terms of the Paris Climate Accord, the agreement is economically damaging to the U.S and does little to help the environment."	"I'll start by saying that despite the significant amount of research I've done on this issue, I don't think I'm completely informed. I'm young and try reading liberal and conservatives perspectives, as I believe that's the only way to reach any objective truth. I've also had an incredibly hard time finding a bipartisan source that lays out what exactly the US has to/has done to adhere to these terms. Also, please refute all of the 4 arguments I'm presenting, but the main point I'm trying to make is the last one about China.

From what I understand the Paris Climate Agreement, though voluntary, is a pledge to reduce carbon emissions in the next 1-2 decades, though every country has vowed to do this at very different rates. But also, the US has agreed to fund other nations $3 billion to help them make this change to cleaner energy. But the agreement requires China to make very little changes, at least not for a long time compared to what we've pledged to do.

To the US, this means even tougher regulations and taxes for businesses despite the fact that some studies indicate that the agreement, even if fully implemented globally, would make very little difference environmentally. It would also cost Americans millions of jobs, though I understand the argument that the times are changing and nonrenewable energy may eventually become obsolete.

Despite the fact that little will happen environmentally by withdrawing from the deal, I've heard various arguments. The most popular one is that while PCA won't cure the planet, *it's the first time countries have come together and acknowledged it's a problem.* Well if that's true, then why are we already planning and implementing these strict regulations if it's just ""opening a dialogue""? Is that not a bit presumptuous to mandate these when we have very little knowledge about the possible results of the agreement? Plus, there's still the open question as to what degree human impact actually has on climate.

I've also heard the argument that *Trump could've just revised the terms of the PCA, but he didn't and withdrew instead.* How is Trump able to just edit the terms of the deal Obama's administration already agreed to? What source indicates that it's that simple? Furthermore, didn't Trump kinda suggest renegotiating it anyways but was rejected by other world leaders? And why on earth would they dismiss that and still bash him for withdrawing?

A conservative argument I've heard against the PCA is that the agreement will immensely hurt developing countries, who are not yet ready to make the switch to cleaner energy.

Another argument I've heard is regarding the China point is that *we offshore a lot of manufacturing there for cheap labor and are essentially contributing to China's tremendous pollution.* I understand, but **this is where my most important argument/question comes in.** Isn't the reason for the large amount of offshoring *because* of the strict regulations and government interference in the free market? So why would we exacerbate this economic problem by imposing even MORE regulations and encourage MORE companies to offshore? Because China doesn't have to adhere to the standards that we have and has stated that they will do it at a much slower rate than the US, it seems like the PCA will do nothing but hurt the American economy. Because as more and more environmental regulations are put into the place in the US and because China won't do it for a much longer amount of time, it seems like producers will be even MORE encouraged to send jobs overseas to avoid these. 

In short, what sense is there in allowing China to continue polluting while the US takes extreme measures much earlier? Wouldn't it actually empower the US economy if China did the same thing as us? It seems like it would actually bring economic prosperity to both countries if they were on the same page on this because producers would be more inclined to keep their jobs here in the US rather than offshoring?

Please correct any misconceptions I have about this. Again, I'm young and want to be educated on this issue but it I just can't shake the feeling that Trump actually did the right thing by withdrawing from this agreement.

t3_1v576a	"I believe that we shouldn't intervene or try to prevent the extinction of endangered species, because human intervention is a form of natural selection. CMV"	"I thoroughly believe that due to the fact that humans are a part of nature, every human action is a part of the process of evolution. Therefore, if a certain species becomes endangered, it happens because it was unable to adapt to its current environment, which of course involves humans.

Furthermore, i hold that the sensivity towards the various species which face extinction is hugely subjective. Greater and more impressive animals are much more likely to be protected than lesser and/or unimpressive animals. Take for example panda bears. Without human protection, they would have gone extinct by now. I can understand they can be used for profit (tourism etc.) , but i try to show that our sense of sympathy is largely guided and somewhat ostensible.

I find that the motive behind protecting endangered species, derives partly from the arrogancy of our species, which suggests that we have disturbed natural selection and altered nature irreversibly, while in reality natural selection works through our every action.

t3_amakae	CMV: Democrats impeaching Trump is a waste of time	"Disclaimer: Trump should be punished for any crimes he committed. I just think there are more pressing matters for the country that don't involve Mike Pence becoming the President.

TL;DR - We have a little over a decade to transition the entire energy infrastructure to carbon neutral or negative sources; we have actual for-profit prisons; we have legal and pervasive federal corruption; we have multiple unnecessary war involvements. I could continue, but impeaching Trump solves none of these, and will likely distract from them. Democrats need to prove, over these next 2 years, that these policies I've outlined are goals for them as well or I'm giving up on them.

So,

The past decades of US government have seen a vast shift away from regulating financial, military, oil, prison, education, etc. sectors in the name of ""the free market"". This ""free market"" is at odds with getting people good and cheap healthcare, stopping climate change, and turning back monopolizing forces. The democrats, or a third party, need to recapture the legal infrastructure to stop wealth inequality and corruption. 

At this point it seems unlikely this will occur. On one hand, republicans control the Supreme Court, the Senate, and the White House. On the other hand, the democratic party appears to be blind and/or complicit on these issues. If they want to win in 2020, they need to prove to Americans that they aren't complicit, and the impeachment process will do essentially nothing to convince me of that. I get that a lot of impeachment talk is just political theater, but I know I’m not alone here about substantive issues."	1	
t3_8zze61	"CMV: Environmental degradation is at a degree now which cannot be reversed effectively within the next couple of decades, not to mention that the environmental issues are not being properly addressed."	"I have a very pessimistic outlook on the future in the environmental sense, which I think will also tie into economic fronts as well. This view was produced by, quite frankly, the media, but multiple podcasts (in particular the *CBC: 2050 Degrees of Change*) and news sources have convinced me of the overwhelming devastation of our environment and the long-lasting and dreadful consequences that come with it. The effects of climate change is seen everywhere. However, the policies to deal with them, from my perspective, are always being compromised for short-term economic benefits. This is understandable for policy-makers, but it is also very concerning for me. Is there a side of the picture that I am not seeing?

Update:

Frankly I don't think I'd be able to be convinced that climate change right now is a natural thing or is not happening at all. For 1) I have first hand experience that it is really happening, and 2) from statistics it really doesn't fit in the natural cycle. What I DO want to be convinced of is the idea that it's being taken care of properly, and that, because of this, its effects won't ruin the planet."	1

t3_1z3seg	Golden Rice is a red herring and GMOs will do little to fight global hunger. CMV	"**Please note: this isn't about the science of GMOs, nor the politics of Monsanto**

First off, let's split world hunger into two categories: food insecurity and famine. The former occurs in every nation in the world. In the US alone, [roughly 15% of households experienced food insecurity last year.](http://www.ers.usda.gov/publications/err-economic-research-report/err155.aspx#.Uw9zsfRdVbk). This obviously isn't a problem of scarcity in America's food supply, so much as a problem of inequality and holes in the social safety net, neither of which GMOs will nor are addressing.

Famine is different. While its often triggered by drought, famine is exacerbated by local political disfunction, warfare and global inaction. The Great Chinese Famine, starvation under Stalin's regime and the current state of North Korea are examples of massive starvation caused almost exclusively by political decisions. Also Zimbabwe's agriculture collapsed when Mugabe seized all the farms to redistribute to his political allies. 

In Somalia, [draught has been the primary cause of the deaths of a quarter million people between 2010 and 2012](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/02/world/africa/somalia-famine/). And while that's a large number, [the world easily produced enough food to feed everyone at risk](http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/05/13/un-one-third-of-food-produced-for-human-consumption-is-uneaten/) 

Could we create a GMO that would thrive in the severe draught that plagued Somalia? Maybe, though I imagine there's a limit on yields during drought regardless of whatever superseed you use. But why wait until then? [We already produce enough food to make the entire world fat.](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eric-holt-gimenez/world-hunger_b_1463429.html). And don't necessarily need GMOs to [keep feeding our growing global population.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v485/n7397/full/nature11069.html)

Instead, it's lack of political will and organization that's causing huge disparity in food access throughout the world. Which brings me to Golden Rice.

Yes, it would be great to give vitamin A deficient children a food product that will save half a million kids every year. Wonderful. However, if we already have enough food being produced in the world, and already know the cause of these deaths. Why are we waiting for a GMO rice to be produced to save these lives? Why not just distribute vitamin A supplements to these kids in need? And furthermore, once Golden Rice is approved and being sold on the market. What's to guarantee that it will get to those in need, when we can't even guarantee food to 15% of Americans?

Just ask the pharma industry. Saving lives is about one thing, [profit.](http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=15923)"	1	
t3_6iki04	CMV: Cash For Clunkers was a Massive Handout to the Auto Industry And It Hurt the Economy	"""Cash For Clunkers"" was a temporary government program that provided a credit to purchasers of new vehicles of a fuel efficiency of >22 MPG if they destroyed their old vehicle that's <25 years old and <18 MPG, and in working condition.

The program is a prime example of the [Broken Window Fallacy](https://mises.org/library/broken-window-fallacy), the idea that if someone went around smashing windows, it would help the economy because it would create jobs in window repair.


So the first effect it had was creating incentives for the purchase of new cars. Buyers could get a credit from the government for trading in their old car to be demolished, to use for a new car. In this way, the government subsidized the purchase of the new car.

The government partially paying for people to get new cars is already a massive handout to the auto industry, but that's not all.

By demolishing the old cars that were workable, the government effectively reduced the supply of used cars. This caused used car prices to go up, thus hurting the poor, and making new cars more appealing due to a lower price spread.

So the law is a handout to auto companies in two ways. First by subsidizing new automobile purchased, and secondly by reducing availability of used cars, thus reducing the impact of the substitute effect.

As for hurting the economy, the program involved destroying items of value without creating additional value. It simply tried to change consumer behavior while eliminating fuel inefficient cars voluntarily.

With used car prices rising as a result of the government reducing the supply, Americans were forced to spend more to meet their transportation needs. This reduced the amount of remaining income they have to spend on other discretionary products of services, thus slowing economic growth.

Increases in the price of non-discretionary goods has been known to trigger or prolong recessions, most notably with oil. 

I believe that by providing a handout to the auto industry, the U.S government benefited automobile industries at the expense of the rest of the economy.

t3_b3dlph	CMV: Bernie Sanders is too old to be president.	"I thought about including Biden in the title, I know he isn't technically running yet, but he has been flirting with the idea so I'm including him in this, however this is mostly about Sanders, so when I say ""he"" it's usually about him. I am more familiar with Sanders campaign/ideology than Biden's, so that's the main reason for that.  

Let me just say that I support Bernie's policies, and I voted for him in the 2016 primaries, so this isn't coming from a place of political disagreement. Nor am I concerned that just because he's older he won't care as much about younger citizens. I think Sanders has made it very clear that this is not the case.

My main concern comes down to this: energy. Being president of the United States is widely known as one of the most stressful/demanding jobs that exists. To counter this many people say that Sanders has served as a Senator for decades. This is true, but I don't think it changes my point at all. Being a Senator, while I'm sure is stressful in its own right, quite frankly does not compare to being President. We've all seen the before and after pictures of prior presidents, and it's evident from those the toll the job takes on you. 

Will Sanders be able to keep up with this demanding job given his age? Well, it doesn't seem to be affecting the way he campaigns, which is a fair point against my argument. But he wouldn't even be in office until essentially two years from now, and who knows what could change in that time. Also, is he planning on serving two terms? Because running for reelection at age 83, after already serving 4 years in the most stressful job, seems unlikely. 

Sure, Sanders seems fine right now. But in old age that can change literally overnight. 

To sum up my argument: Sanders is too old to serve as President of the United States, one of the most demanding jobs in the world, because of the energy and mental power needed to successfully execute that job that dwindles in old age.  

It feels sort of uncomfortable to talk about age like this, but I think it is a viable concern that potential voters have. Also, I'm sure there are a few points that could be made for and against my argument that I didn't cover in the posts, so I'm sorry about that.

t3_24o02r	CMV: Free-market capitalism is real-time democracy	"As consumers in a free market we vote numerous times every day using our wallets.

We vote on how important environmental issues are by paying this hybrid manufacturer or that truck manufacturer. We vote on cost vs quality, efficiency vs effectiveness, the importance of privacy, on and on, every day.

People start companies to create supply which meets demand. That demand is power we all exercise every day. Wal-mart will disappear if we stop paying it to exist and instead buy local. Facebook will disappear if we stop giving it our personal information. Going down the list of CMV topics, a large portion of them could be solved through majority rule by us changing our actions as consumers in a free-market. And we don't need to wait until the next election cycle to do so.

Of course consumer awareness is important, and can be manipulated through advertising and behavioral economics. But that's no different than voter awareness or political misinformation.

t3_2ntrs6	CMV: i think the recent choice of OPEC (mostly suadi arabia) to not reduce oil production is a good thing in many ways	"ok let me outline a few points that i think make it a good thing.

1. cheaper gas. flat out benefits me directly.

2. now that oil prices are cheaper some of the worlds dirtiest sources of oil (tar sands here in alberta, shale oil, fracking, etc) are no longer profitable.

3. with those sources now no longer profitable, i think this might finally push first world nations to seriously consider investing in alternative energy like nuclear as well as renewables. china has already decided to invest heavily in renewables and even nuclear power. they're stated their reducing their consumption.


now i know that with lower oil prices oil consumption tends to rise. but i think that might be short term. everyone knows how expensive oil can get and they may be more cautious about increasing oil spending in long term plans. they probably know that oil prices will rise again and planning long term under the assumption that oil prices will remain low is a terrible idea.

t3_clpc0o	CMV: the EU shouldn't join the BRI	"The U.S. China trade war has significant implications. Zhou of the South China Morning Post writes Chinese firms are less enthusiastic about investing in the country’s trade and infrastructure strategy and Beijing is more wary of throwing money at the BRI as it comes under pressure from the trade war and falling forex reserves. Because of this, China lacks the funding to continue the development of the BRI. Meyer of UPenn writes China’s planned to use at least $400 billion in funding from government banks, but the program has ballooned beyond infrastructure construction. BRI lending by major [Chinese]banks has dropped by 89% since 2015, and lending by commercial banks has ceased entirely. The EU joining the BRI solves these problems. Ciutrain of the European Institute of Romania finds that China cannot financially and logistically manage such an ambitious project alone.  The only possible partner is the EU. 

We agree that the EU is the only viable option to fund the BRI. Now, Climate change is a looming threat, yet it’s consequences are preventable. Turrentine of the National Resources Defence Council writes that climate scientists concluded that if humans don’t take immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2040, the consequences will be baked into the planet.

China, once a key contributor to climate change has cleaned up their act. The World Economic Forum finds after years of industrialization, China’s environmental challenges are nearing a tipping point. The factories and power plants that have have polluted its air, water and soil, to the point where environmental hazards could lead to a significant risk to China’s society and economy. Because of this, China has taken steps to improve the environment domestically. Gardiner of National Geographic writes that Chinese car emissions standards set to take effect in 2020 will be comparable to Western ones. But the focus remains on industry. China has closed 103 coal-fired power plants and it cut steel production by 50 million tons. This is significant since China, a country that the Resources Institute finds contributes 26% of greenhouse gas emissions is taking steps to limit their environmental impact.

These actions have been counteracted by the BRI. The first reason why is because of coal plants. Lu of Friends of the Earth writes that “As China has reduced its dependence on coal domestically it has expanded overseas, to relieve excess domestic capacity.” This is quantified as Tabuchi finds that China is planning 1600 coal projects in 62 countries with the BRI. This leads Lelyveld of the RFA to conclude that, Chinese financial institutions are the world's largest funder of overseas coal plants. These coal plants are problematic since Mooney of the Washington Post finds that New coal plants that are planned could produce 150 tons of CO2 during their lifetime.

The second reason why is because of general infrastructure. The construction and use of the infrastructure planned with the BRI produces emissions.  Zadek of Brookings states New infrastructure accounts for half of new sources of emissions. Investments BRI countries could make up 60 percent of global infrastructure, so BRI countries could be the largest source of growing carbon emissions over this critical period. 

The third reason is deforestation. Losos of the World Bank reports that BRI roads and railways changing transport costs can shift markets and human populations. This can open frontiers to settlements that involve deforestation. Deforestation is problematic since Bennett of the Climate Institute reports 25% greenhouse gas production comes from deforestation since forests store double the CO2 than the CO2 in the atmosphere, so when deforested occurs, CO2 stored in trees is released into the atmosphere.

The impact is forced migration. The BRI’s increase of global emissions surpasses the 1.5 degree limit for climate change. By ignoring the threshold, the BRI exposes the planet to increasingly harmful natural disasters. The National Wildlife Federation finds that Climate change is worsening the impacts of natural disasters, including hurricanes, megafires, droughts, and floods. As natural disasters become worse, people are forced to flee. The World Bank reports that if greenhouse emissionf15

s aren’t cut, there will be 140 million climate migrants by 2050."	1

Slowly my view has change into humans greatest legacy can only be leaving synthetic life form to continue on. Life that can live almost anywhere, that should be what humans should strive for. The fact that I'm thinking this way is a bit terrifying and unsettling to say the least. But Synthetic life... true synthetic life would be vastly superior to organics and could also take much better care of the ecosystem due to a much better understanding of the world. They can exceed all of out limitations and then some, they aren't bound by death in the traditional sense at the very least they will last much longer then humans do. (per life span) But I can't but entertain these thoughts lately.

t3_2bvf51	"CMV: I think being against nuclear energy its hypocritical, unless you are also against modern civilization."	"Among the non-renewable energies (nuclear, oil, coal, gas...), nuclear is by large the safest and cleanest. Being against it for ecological reasons makes no sense if you are not also against all the others. 

Now, I think renewable energy is the only long-term option we have to mantain or current lifestyle. Nothing would make me happy than being it possible to use them as our sole energy source. Unfortunately that's not possible, for the moment. We have to rely, at least to an extent, on ""dirty"" energy sources.

So every person who is against nuclear energy is being either
a) hypocritical, for not being also against other ""dirty"" energies, or, in case he is against them,
b) against modern civilization, as shutting off all of them and relying only on renewable would be impossible without reducing our energy expenditures to a great extent.

t3_6by65x	CMV: Increasing housing supply in Vancouver and similar expensive housing cities will not reduce prices	"I feel that the focus on increasing housing supply in Vancouver is misguided.

I do understand that zoning regulations mandating single-family-housing in areas that could be replaced with dense towers drives up cost via a simple supply and demand argument.

However, from what I see, our housing market doesn't come from Vancouver. A large amount of the capital in our housing market comes from other places in Canada with better wages and from global wealth internationally.

I feel that increasing housing supply and zoning for more density would not drastically improve the situation?

Why? Because the natural features and loose financial regulations will still ensure that if we threw a bunch of dense housing into the market, there would still be enough demand from elsewhere to ensure this did not translate into more affordable housing.

t3_ir1amd	CMV: Sustainability is impossible in the long-term for humankind on a grand scale.	"I see left and right the idea of sustainability, saving the planet (or humankind), protests involving emissions that people will sometimes DRIVE long distances to be a part of, and the idea that the individual cannot do anything meaningful. It's true that one could drive a fleet of hummers for the rest of their life and do less ecological damage than a person in the US who has one single child.

&#x200B;

You might think of a place like Bhutan as an exception because they have negative emissions, however I think they are a very circumstantial bunch that depends on location, population scale, and a very specific culture that humankind cannot adopt as a whole. I will not accept that as an answer.

&#x200B;

My belief is that humankind cannot stop itself from unsustainable practices and will follow the beat of nature to survive, consume, and reproduce if they have enough opportunity. The first world lifestyle is absolutely and fundamentally unsustainable. Even if by the grace of God everyone were given exactly enough to support the current population so everyone could live in absolute luxury and comfort, we'd just outgrow it and go right back to being unsustainable.

&#x200B;

I see things like a 'self-sustaining city', promotions for electric cars, slow adoption of renewable energy, and it seems at every corner business, corporations, and even individuals will take the unsustainable course to save money and effort even at the expense of the environment and future.

&#x200B;

When I go to stores, I see less food for more money. I see space and opportunity disappearing (entire nursing classes and about 3 job openings in the area). I see overfilled classrooms and overworked and underpaid teachers. I see pictures of trains in India overfilled probably by 10 times the maximum rated capacity. I see schools preparing students for opportunities that are oversaturated. Let's not forget mankind's intent to cut down every last tree (around 200 years if nothing changes). None of that is sustainable either. Everything is getting tighter and more desperate.

&#x200B;

I think the idea of sustainability is well and good, but not enough can be done to dispute anyone claiming that the 2020's is the beginning of turmoil. Well, perhaps there is already turmoil but not quite in our personal realms. People tune out the others who point out these facts, as if ignoring the problems would make them go away.

&#x200B;

I would really like my viewpoint changed. I don't want to feel like the odd-one-out cynic. I want a logical explanation to dispute it. Would you have to kill off the majority to create sustainability in a sustainable future? Even then, wouldn't it be a band-aid solution? Some say it's too late to change anything and eventually get so bad that survivors would have to exist in artificial environments, however the University of Arizona Biosphere II makes me wonder about the feasibility of that. I doubt sustainability can exist in even those environments. I think all living things are meant to grow and consume without mind for sustainability. It's in our nature, isn't it?

t3_36nz4d	"CMV: We need to develop alternative energy capabilities, but that shouldn't include an expansion of nuclear power."	"I have a couple of concerns about nuclear energy. Overall, I'm not terribly concerned about the risks involved with nuclear power plants - sure, Fukushima and all that, but realistically many more people are killed by other forms of energy generation (I believe!). That's not to say that this isn't a worry, on some level. It's just not my top worry.

I am, however, concerned about nuclear waste. The goal of developing alternative energies, to my mind, is to reduce our environmental footprint and save our ecosystem as we know it. Sure, we might slow global warming using nuclear energy - but to my knowledge, we don't really have any good way of dealing with nuclear waste. Investing in nuclear energy is just a way of trading one environmental problem for another.

Second, other forms of renewable energy are increasingly cost-effective and efficient. There's no reason to be generating nuclear power when we can do just as well with other forms of energy.

Third, nuclear energy is an international conundrum. If we could move away from nuclear energy in the United States and invest globally in other forms of renewable resources, we would be able to prove, in some small way, that nuclear energy programs are unnecessary - and, therefore, give us more leverage to refuse to tolerate them in diplomatic talks.

t3_54mj46	CMV: We have to start geoengineering the planet if we want to avoid the death of most life on Earth	"What we refer to as climate change, or global warming, is really a kind of suicidal experiment with our atmosphere that knows no geological precedent. The ocean is acidifying [more rapidly](http://www.vox.com/2014/9/10/6131139/ocean-acidification-fastest-300-million-years) than at any point during the past 300 million year in the Earth's history. To illustrate what this means, consider this: There was no such thing as a ""mammal"" 300 million years ago.

That's the big problem here that most people don't seem to understand: This entire change taking place around us right now is extremely rapid compared to the atmospheric changes that normally happen on our planet. Our civilization has never been exposed to anything even remotely similar to this, most species on our planet have never had to survive through anything like this. 

During normal climatic changes, atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations change gradually. In response to these changes, the Earth warms. This then causes the sea level to rise and glaciers to melt. This rise in sea level protects fragile oceanic ecosystems, like [coral reefs.](https://www.carbonbrief.org/rising-seas-could-ease-coral-bleaching) Now that we are burning fossil fuels in massive amounts, the temperatures are rising faster than the sea level rise can keep up with. As a result, the coral reefs are exposed to conditions that are very deadly for them.

How much of a temperature rise can the coral reefs cope with? Not a whole lot. A 1.5 degree temperature rise above pre-industrial means that [more than 90% of the coral reefs are gone.](http://takvera.blogspot.nl/2012/09/global-warming-imperils-coral-reefs-2.html) A 1.2 degree temperature rise means we're losing around half of our coral reefs. This doesn't happen overnight mind you, the problem is simply that once every few years, a warmer planet will have moments during which the temperatures are so high that the coral reefs can not survive. The ecosystem then disintegrates and you're left with an ocean floor covered with dead and dying animals.

To ensure a 1.5 degree temperature rise requires us to reduce CO2 concentration to below 350 parts per million, a level we hit in the late 80's. In other words, it's too late by now unless we were to figure out some way to suck CO2 out of the atmosphere. When the coral reefs die, we'll start to see civilization as we know it fall apart too. Globally, [1 billion people](http://wwf.panda.org/about_our_earth/blue_planet/coasts/coral_reefs/coral_importance/) depend on the coral reefs, as this is where massive numbers of fish live, much of the ocean harbors comparatively very little life.

To make matters worse, the coral reefs perform an important ecological function, as these reefs produce Dimethyl Sulfide, which is released into the atmosphere, where it creates clouds that serve to cool down the Earth. When the reefs start dying, the dimethyl sulfide ceases to be released, which then leads to further warming, which then leads to more death. It's life on Earth itself, that keeps the planet habitable for life.

If you want to see what a world with catastrophic global warming looks like, take a look at Syria. Before the civil war erupted, Syria suffered a massive drought, [thought to be the worst in 900 years](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/mar/02/syrias-drought-has-likely-been-its-worst-in-900-years). It's this drought that forced people to leave the countryside and enter the cities, where they could find no jobs and where ethnic tensions began to increase. Take a guess what's going to happen in the years ahead of us. The refugee crisis now seen in Europe is just the tip of the crisis that's ahead of us.

This isn't just some issue where we might risk losing some natural beauty, where some forest that we happen to like or a charismatic species might be lost. This is an existential crisis on the scale of a nuclear war, but it's not treated as such. It threatens the very survival of civilization itself.

It seems to me that it's necessary to intervene to preserve a habitable planet. When the Great Barrier Reef was faced with extreme heat, the Australian government should have implemented an emergency weather control program. [One kilogram of well placed sulfur in the atmosphere can offset the equivalent of several hundred thousand kilogram of carbon dioxide.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratospheric_sulfate_aerosols_(geoengineering)) To just sit by and watch as the Great Barrier Reef dies is insanity.

It is in fact arguable that to geoengineer the planet is more natural than it is to simply watch the present catastrophe unfold. Normally when coal is burned, large amounts of sulfur would be released too. The smog this creates is unpleasant however and harms our health, so we tend to filter it out. If coal naturally burns, such sulfur would be released into the atmosphere too. Similarly, iron can be used to fertilize the ocean with. This can fill a gap that was created by the decimation of large animals like whales, whose dives to great depths recirculates iron in the ocean.

The reason none of this happens is because climate change was put on the international agenda by NGO's, that happen to be motivated by an ideology that inherently favors the environment. As a result, we tend to look at climate change in a bipartisan way that underestimates the seriousness of the threat. This is not about sacrificing economic growth to save polar bears or panda's. It's not a question of what we find important in life, it's a question of whether we want to survive or not.

I'm not per definition arguing that the problem has to be solved through geoengineering, but rather, that it's now time for us to use geoengineering to prevent the worst from happening. Geoengineering now has to be used to ensure that when we do figure out how to reduce carbon emissions to zero, there is still something left to salvage. It's unpleasant, potentially dangerous and it disgusts me on a guttural level, but it's the only real viable option I see that we now have."	1	
t3_bhdblt	CMV: we should have universal jurisdiction for environmental crimes.	"I believe that crimes against the environment should have universal jurisdiction for a few reasons.

1: Because crimes against the environment have a global impact and not a local impact and victims of a crime should always have access to justice, crimes against the environment should be able to be tried globally. Crimes like murder, theft and other standard crimes typically only impact individuals in a particular nation. If a person gets raped in Afghanistan that doesn’t really impact Australia. But when someone grossly pollutes Afghanistan, that warms up Australia and negatively impacts their standard of living, economy, and environment. So on a principle basis, victims all across the globe have a right to justice and so should be able to try crimes against the environment.

2: This stops the coercion that smaller countries face to have lax environmental regulations. Smaller countries are basically forced to have lax environmental regulations as it’s the only way for them to be competitive on the global economy. This is because all of the other advantages they provide, lower cost of labor, cheaper land, tax benefits, etc. are provided by other underdeveloped nations. So to gain an advantage, they decrease environmental regulations and that forces a race to the bottom. Lax environmental regulations would no longer be an incentive for multi national companies if they can still be sued for their actions by other nations. This means that countries aren’t forced to have lax regulations, preventing environmental harm.

3: Countries won’t fear increasing environmental regulations. The point at which environmental regulations have to be respected by every single nation, is the point at which countries will not fear increasing them. Because nations will be able to sue other countries for not implementing strict environmental regulations, they will not fear being left behind if they implement strict environmental regulations. This is a good thing as it allows us to make rapid and massive changes in a short term, which is required for the worsening issue of climate change.

I just thought that this may be a good idea and understand some of the downsides (weaponization of litigation, effects on IR, etc.), but I still believe in the idea overall. I was wondering if you guys could help me see the light and understand why this may be a crap idea."	1

I've also seen reduction of fresh water as an argument of overpopulation concerns. My main problem with all of this is that where I live it rains all the time. In fact it's raining right now outside my house. This year during hurricane season ( Southeast U.S) our river even flooded and damaged some of the local buildings. My biggest concern is that our water sources will become polluted from our terrible environmental protections laws. But I don't see us running out.

t3_dnkp1i	"CMV: The ""Hating on popular things cause kids like them"" trend is totally unnecessary and hostile"	"Hating on popular things like Fortnite, Ariana Grande, and basically whatever is currently popular in the public eye is totally unnecessary and hostile, especially if the main reasoning for hating on *whatever the thing is* is that kids like it. Like, just because kids like someone, doesn't mean everyone who's not a kid should hate it. I get the whole ""annoying kids are ruining it by being annoying"" thing, but that shouldn't be the whole reason for hating it and it doesn't give you the right to hate on the popular thing and its fandom. It isn't okay to hate something simply because kids like it and you don't like kids or you don't like kids that are specifically annoying. Not every kid is annoying, and not every person in the fandom is a kid, and it's okay for people in different age ranges to like the same things, like a show, or a video game. It isn't fair at all to hate on something specifically because kids like it. You don't have to participate in or even like it because you don't want to interact with kids, but just don't put other people down for it or go around saying ""X is only for little kids and all the adults who use X are idiots!!"" blah blah blah.

t3_1vxyf3	I believe that fracking in the UK is a necessity for the short term and protesters are deluded. CMV	"Disclaimer first: I believe global warming could be a very real threat, and obviously should be prepared against. Having said that:

Since Thatcher's era, our industry has dwindled to the point where we are now effectively a consumer society. Areas of Britain, the north in particular, have been gutted, and unemployment in these areas are a grim read. All because the industry moved away.

With fracking, we have a genuine opportunity to bring a form of industry back to the UK, with no provisos due to the fact that it is a natural substance rooted in the ground. No manufacture costs that hold businesses back from coming to the UK- if you want the materials, you have to come into the country to extract it, you have to employ people to do it.

When people also hear the word 'fossil fuel', it becomes a buzz-word for bad. And sometimes rightly so. However, the extraction of gas is a lesser evil than oil- its slightly cleaner for starters. And, with extraction coming to the UK, we may be able to switch to a less damaging product in a host of areas, such as in our cars. What keeps us back at the moment is the sheer cost of importing gas from areas like Russia, and with a domestic product available, so too will cheaper energy. Of course it's not the ideal scenario, but right now we have no other alternatives. 'Green' energy carry with it a huge carbon debt made from the production stage that relies on oil, and are proving to be inefficient and intrusive towards people's lives. We need to slow down implementation of green sources and plough that money into research and development, but also reduce dependency on oil, something that, for the mean time, gas can provide."	1	
t3_7zsl2p	CMV: Earth would be better off without humans.	"This is a topic that has cause a great deal of controversy in my life.

I'm not sure if I'm just being pessimistic, but I just feel like humans are destroying this planet. I appreciate that we are an amazing species (being the only ones we know to be ... the way we are).

However there are just such a great number of people who want to take and take and take from the planet until there is nothing left.

Yes we have environmentalists and people who are about animals and recycling. But when it comes down to it these people are out numbered by those who would take the last fish from the ocean and chop down the last tree just from profit and leave this world barren without a care in the world.

I'd love to be proven wrong...."	1	
t3_5i1137	CMV:Humans will never truly want to protect the environment	"There are many ways we can attempt to slow the progression of climate change.  Here will be listed a needed systemic change, and some individual habits that must be adopted by the vast majority of the global population.  The truth of the matter is that we as a society, no, as a species will never adopt any of these.

One of the most obvious ways to help the environment is to abolish fossil fuels and move toward renewable energy (like wind farms and hydroelectric dams) and other alternatives (like nuclear power).  Unfortunately, the oil and gas companies have hundreds of billions of dollars and therefore nearly as much influence on environmental directive as the governments themselves.  As long as oil companies exist, there will continue to be pockets lined to keep the coal burning.  Due to the sheer wealth that lies in the fossil fuel industry, in addition to the fragile economic conditions in coal mining towns, this kind of systemic change can never happen.

On an individual level, people could recycle, use less resources, use sustainable transportation and eat less meat.  Unfortunately, even one of these things is a tall order for most people on Earth.

Recycling is probably the most feasible of these, which is why it's already fairly widespread.  However, we could still do more but we're not.  Why?  Because we're lazy and we have no time.  There are still people who are too lazy to separate garbage from recycling.  *We don't even have to sort the recycling where I live!*  In addition, why would we want to repair our torn clothing when we can throw it out and buy more?  You don't see many people keeping their meat scraps, bones and limp veggies to make soup when we can throw that stuff out and buy it in a can.  Composting and separate organic waste collection are also underutilized.

Now onto the habits we actually need to bring into mainstream culture but won't.  Like using less resources in our daily lives.  We all waste energy, even the cheapskates.  Be it leaving lights on in unoccupied rooms, running water for five minutes to get it cold enough to drink or turning on the television while away to ""keep your pets company"", there are many things we could do but won't.  It's commonly suggested to adjust one's thermostat by a couple of degrees to save on electricity, however many people won't do this because being comfortable is more important than conserving energy and reducing the electric bill.

Walking, cycling and taking public transit.  It sounds simple, right?  Again, people won't do this either.  Realistically, only fitness enthusiasts are going to even consider cycling everywhere, and walking can be very time-consuming.  People who can afford the convenience, freedom and luxury of their own personal vehicle will always prefer their vehicle.  There's also the stigma that public transit is only for the poor.  It doesn't help that buses in many cities smell like urine and are filled with drunk and/or miserable-looking people.  Most of all, though, there's the fact that public transportation systems in the Western world are seemingly made to incentivize people into driving, with nearly all suburban communities receiving little or no bus service.  Add onto that municipalities raising bus fares to justify declining ridership, and it's no wonder people would rather drive.

Mainstream vegetarianism/veganism would probably be the one thing on this list that would make the biggest difference, but it's also the most difficult one to adopt on a global level.  Meat is a staple in most cultures, especially Western.  Even I can't bring myself to give up meat.  Bacon, steak, ribs and chicken are all just too delicious.  Okay, I'll admit that this is a weak argument, but livestock is a real issue within the climate change issue."	1	
t3_4vt9bp	CMV: Human environmental impact exists on a spectrum.	"The title is the primary point, but to give more nuance: environmental impact by humans (by this I mean primarily issues such as greenhouse gas emissions from eating meat, consuming carbon based energy, etc.) exists on a spectrum. Individuals choose where they are comfortable residing on that spectrum in terms of how much relative ""harm"" they are OK with inflicting via their continued existence, and there is no moral ""high ground"" regarding this issue, rather a spectrum of conviction. 
 
As an example - a person might be vegetarian because they believe that the meat industry negatively impacts the environment *too much*. The logical conclusion of that line of reasoning could be that the ultimate goal would be to eliminate all environment-altering inputs, which leaves you with 2 options: end your own life now to eliminate any personal contribution, or spend the rest of your life in a net-positive state, which would require actively changing attitudes (to a measurable degree) towards environmental impact.
 
Regardless of your stance on the issue, any change exists on the margin; eating less meat is marginally better than eating more, riding your bike to work is marginally better than driving, etc., but ultimately what we are describing (relative to the world view in question) is bad vs. less bad, rather than bad vs. good. 
 
TL;DR - personal conviction regarding incremental improvement is not universally applicable; no moral high-ground exists for ""harm reduction"" because that position is inherently hypocritical for the ***vast*** majority of cases.

t3_bg5fnj	CMV: Patanogia donating $10 Million towards climate change sets a bad precedent.	"Title says it all really, [here](https://www.cnn.com/2018/11/29/business/patagonia-10-million-tax-climate-change-trnd/index.html) is an article talking about what they did if you have not heard about it. 

This is not a CMV about climate change, i'm fully aware what is happening to our planet. 

I have to be fully transparent here, originally I was going to say that Patagonia donating money toward climate change is unethical on the basis that it's unfair to the employees, you can't ask your employees to stay late, work harder, and not give raises and then just give away money, even if it was because of a tax cut. After doing some research and trying to refute my own original argument I found that Patanogia is an absolutely amazing place to work and they truly care about their employees. They are also a privately owned company so the CEO is free to do what they want with their profits. 

I think what they should have done, instead of donating money, is given their employees the day off for Earth Day (which happens to be today; as a side note if you read this please do one good thing for the environment today!), and had a company sponsored optional event that involves picking up trash, planting trees, or anything that is good for the Earth. It would be just as good of PR as donating but there is actually something happening, and also it will improve employee morale because even if you don't share the same enthusiasm for improving the environment at least you get a paid day off. 

The reason why I think this sets a bad precedent is because it is going to put pressure on other companies to start donating money toward climate change and just writing a checks as opposed to action. I think this is a poor solution because many companies are just looking for the media points, and the tax write offs, as opposed to actually doing something. 

For example, XYZ Inc. contributes to a lot of pollution but hey the just wrote a 9 figure tax deductible check and all anybody reads is headlines so XYZ Inc. is a great woke company. 

Another reason why I think it sets a bad precedent is because if Patanogia were to be a publicly traded company, I would be strongly against them donating this money. Most investors are not billionaires or even millionaires and are just people trying to put money away for retirement, to be invested fully in a company and have that company just give your money away to me seems unethical. With Patanogia doing this, I can't help to think now other companies are going to be pressured to start giving money to climate change, as opposed to action, or giving money to the shareholders that help keep the company afloat. 

While there is no denying what Patanogia did is overall a good thing I can't help to think that other companies that don't take care of their employees the way they do are now going to be pressured to donate, which may not to be fair to the employees who work their or the shareholders who trusted that company with their savings."	1

People long for a ""slow news day"" because they might get a break from these titles of *death, destruction, and Armageddon coming to a city near you.* 

I think much of the chronic anxiety that seems so prevalent today stems from an increased focus on negative events worldwide, mixed with human nature to retain information about threats and forget positive, uplifting information.

While it's important to know what's going on in the world, watching the news isn't the only way to do it. It's just too much, looping the same information you heard at breakfast or the water cooler from a colleague, except with images to disturb you more. I'm always personally left with a sick dread after flicking off the news, or reading my trending topics on Twitter. 

Why should we bother watching world news? It'd be difficult to argue you'd be left out of the loop if you don't watch the news. I actively avoid the news and still manage to know what's going on pretty much as fast as anybody else. If I want to understand an issue more, I wouldn't watch the news anyway, I'd read about the issue on Wikipedia, or some other source. 

I'm sure there are some compelling arguments on the other side, but I haven't heard any that have convinced me we should all be watching the news. I'm curious to hear your thoughts, and whether you can change my view. "	1

You have parents neglecting and abusing their kids. Such situations are not unheard of. It's pretty obvious that they have their own priorities first despite what they claim.

However, this is not the case if the family is from a ""good"" background and the child had a ""good"" upbringing. Some parents invest a lot of time, money, and effort into their kids. For example, they will buy expensive toys for their kids or send them to private schools. Surely these parents want the best for their kids?

But for the average person, there are extremely few political powers you have. You can protest, vote for president, and vote on ordinances the county approves. You can not affect what the president does once he's in, and protesting doesn't always work. So they're kind of right. Little differences that fuck over different groups change every four years, but all politics will do is create unnecessary conflict. For example, Trump does x. I disagree with x, you agree, but guess what? It doesn't matter, Trump will do x or y regardless of what any of us think. It's between Congress and him. I don't like him personally because he doesn't believe in climate change, but he has done positive things. He's not the first corrupt politician, and he won't be the last. I personally think he's an idiot but like I said, whether you are literally a Nazi or a Communist what you think doesn't matter once the president is in.

t3_41ufc9	CMV:Humanity is Doomed	"Every single day your turn on the news or read a newspaper what do you see? Death, destruction, depravity, etc. It seems like humans are getting worse by the minute. People would argue that the media purposely publishes these types of stories more than the good ones, as they get more views. But that still does not change the fact that humanity is in serious trouble. Here's a couple reasons why I think so.

1. Extremist nut jobs are everywhere you look. Extreme left wingers forcing their PC bs on everyone, Extreme right wingers using the migrant crisis to spread racism and fear, Extreme religious backwards 7th century cavemen chopping off heads and shouting mumbo jumbo to supposedly appease their god, and the list goes on and on. People have said that the only way to defeat the ideology of extremism is with peace and tolerance, but at the rate these groups are growing that seems unlikely. For now most of them are just vocal, but what happens when they turn violent and start rioting?

2. Our planet is being drained. Big fishing companies are sweeping the oceans clean with trawling boats, destroying the livelihood of sustenance fisherman everywhere. Toxic leaks are poisoning the sea, killing off untold amounts of marine life(lookin at you Fukushima!) and poisoning the air. Whole forests are being decimated along with all the species who depend on them for sustenance. I'm not a tree-hugger by any means, but I'm pretty sure chopping down all the trees is gonna have a negative effect on the earth's oxygen levels(and last time I checked humans need that to breathe.) If we keep going like this eventually the whole worlds' gonna end up like China AKA Smog city.

Maybe I'm just paranoid. Maybe everything will get better in the near future. But right now humanity is standing on the brink of disaster and it seems like we are trying to throw ourselves over. I know nothing lasts forever but for a species to go from hunting with sharpened sticks and living in mud huts, to building crafts that can explore the depths of space and beyond, only to end up destroying themselves seems a little....anticlimactic?

t3_867i6j	"CMV: Damage due to poaching is practically nothing compared to the number of species that are driven to extinction by deforestation, farming and pollution. In comparison, reddit's outrage should really be directed towards that, and in fact, their own governments and lifestyles"	"**PREFACE:** I AGREE THAT POACHING SUCKS AND IT MAKES ME SAD TOO. 


For every rhino species that dies due to poaching, thousands of species die due to deforestation and ""benign"" activities. Poaching, in comparison, is almost nothing. Yet, for all of Reddit's hate towards poor third world criminals, how many of them hate their lifestyle and government for the damage it causes? I don't really have numbers on me, but I'm pretty sure that the damage caused by a single American in their lifetime is more than done by a single poacher. In fact, America has one of the highest per capita pollution in the world, and is somehow higher in total emissions than India (which has nearly 4x the population). 



Look, I agree that what happened to the Northern White Rhinos is tragic and poaching sucks, but is it not hypocritical? At least these poachers are poor and have *somewhat* of an excuse (a shitty one but still). Meanwhile, we destroy by simply living. How many more species do we kill?


My main argument is that our outrage should be more towards the current wildly unsustainable lifestyle in the first world.

t3_nqiecf	"CMV: End is nigh; our environmental efforts are too little, too late."	"Let me prefix this by saying I am no expert on any of this; I truly hope I am just catastrophizing and that I’m completely wrong about the bleakness of our situation and that my mind can be changed on the subject. That being said, this is how I’ve come to understand our current global predicament.

Most of our optimistic ecological models predict the future state of the planet’s biosphere will reach a critical irreversible threshold sometime around 2040-2050, at which point a quarter of the world’s land masses will become uninhabitable for most life forms due to desertification; this will happen in conjunction with the rising sea level caused by our warming atmosphere and the subsequent melting of the ice caps - estimated to rise as much as three feet with our current trajectory or a foot in a low emission scenario. 

That’s enough to submerge vast areas and many coastal cities, cut off fresh water supplies, cause sewage treatment plants to fail, and contaminate and destroy huge amounts of agricultural land; all of which will uproot hundreds of millions of people, inevitably leading to mass migrations and widespread scarcity of food sources. 

Temperatures will continue to rise in the oceans, further disrupting coral reefs on a global scale, destroying the breeding grounds for marine fish and mammals as we continue to plunder them for food; devistanting aquatic species everywhere. 

Any good solution to the ecological/environmental crisis is deemed inviable if it cannot turn a profit for investors. With this kind of restrictive bottleneck applied to the process of creating possible innovations we will never develop our technologies fast enough to deal with the multiplying catastrophes that await in the very near future. 

Our current rate of progression towards a sustainable global modality doesn’t seem to be keeping up with the timescale of necessary change that ecological, environmental, and climate scientists tell us we would need to make in order to maintain the planet's homeostasis. 

As a species we don’t seem to have the wherewithal to coordinate ourselves towards a unified goal, even when it concerns our own extinction. We are instead much more concerned with maintaining political discourse, arguing over our differences, reinforcing conceptual divisions and borders. 

We are too easily pacified by the gestural greenwashing of large corporations - many of whom are responsible for much of the problems facing us today, caused by our wasteful consumerism - and are often blind to the hypocrisy of governments and politicians who aim only to control and keep us superficially distracted; squabbling amongst ourselves. 

All ideologies can now be seen to be morally bankrupt in the face of the fallout they create. Capitalism and communism are two sides of the same coin, both assume that land ought to be commodified, and that nature is a resource to be utilised and exploited for human benefit and consumption.

The two richest men in the world are currently putting a majority of their economic investments into funding an escape plan from this planet, with the end goal seemingly to be to save the top 5% of the most wealthy and privileged amung us while the rest are left to fend for themselves on a depleted planet. If that isn’t a symptom of the inevitably of our imminent demise then I don't know what is."	1	
t3_aacnwh	CMV: Colonialism helped avoid a climate catastrophe.	"Much of the climate change problems we face today are attributable to the rapid industrialisation of countries in the Global North. 

Colonialism helped in keeping Global South countries poor - thereby effectively postponing the period where industrialisation would advance in these colonies. Had the world (Global North + South) countries industrialised a simultaneously - we would have faced a climate crisis much earlier. 

Prologue: I am in no way sympathetic to the ideology of colonialism - which I believe is garbage. I am rather trying to find an effective counter against the above perspective. Use of data, facts, and figures to counter the above view, is highly encouraged.

t3_951xkm	CMV: We need a good amount of people to die	"I think that in order to prevent overpopulation and resource depletion, we need something that will kill a very large amount of people. My reasons for believing this is that the earth has finite resources, and if the global population is to large, we won't have enough to go around. Already the extinction rate is rising at an unprecedented rate, and we aren't on track to stop global warming.  If a large part of humanity died, we would be able to postpone these problem for the future, carrying with us the knowledge of how much damage we could do to the environment if we are irresponsible. 

On top of saving the environment, we would user in a new golden age of opportunity for the survivors of the apocalypse. look at the black death, it killed a large amount of people, but allowed for peasants to escape the feudal contract. If the black death never came about, we might still be ruled over by kings and popes, living in poverty. Every time there has been a large amount of land freed up, it creates prosperity. 

Lastly, we already have a good candidate to do this: H1N5. It kills 60% of all people it infects, and it only needs a few mutations to become airborne and hyper infections. Maybe after we decrease the world population we would live in a much better world. If your not dead. "	1	
t3_2ddkrp	CMV: limiting fossil fuels is the only way to reduce carbon emissions	"Most of the schemes I have seen to reduce carbon emissions involve various ways of reducing the carbon emissions of a certain activity. For example we might be encouraged to buy fuel efficient cars, take the train instead of an airplane, eat vegetarian food, put solar cells on the roof etc. I claim that these schemes will do nothing to reduce carbon emissions.

Lets say that a person owns a car that requires 200 liters of gasoline per month. They then replace it with a 100 liter gasoline per month. What will happen is that someone else will buy and burn the 100 liters that was saved. If we cut fuel consumption of cars in half the amount of cars would double or people would buy bigger lawnmowers or eat more meat. The fuel is still going to be used. 

The only way to reduce emissions is to leave fossil fuels in the ground. Currently we produce roughly 5 billion cubic meters of oil every year. As long as we produce that much oil co2 emissions won't decline. The only way to reduce emissions would be if the oil producing countries decided to reduce production by lets say 50 million cubic meters/year every year.

This would create a shortage of oil and that would mean that people would find ways to use less oil. Trying to reduce your consumption while production stays the same just means the oil will be bought by someone else. Please change my view as I am not very optimistic about oil producing countries agreeing to leaving tens of billions of cubic meters of oil in the ground.

t3_4k3y1e	CMV: Electrical energy storage technology will totally eclipse hydrogen technology.	"This is a view point that I would really like to be changed because after working with hydrogen fuel cells I really like them. But I'm stuck as to what advantage they will have going forward. The fight when it comes to cars seems to be range vs. accessibility. Electric cars have range issues but are making rapid improvements to this limitation. Hydrogen vehicles require entirely new infrastructure and the price of hydrogen will likely stay high as electrolysing water is expensive and inefficient - meaning that accessing fuel will be prohibitive. 

As batteries get better, they will probably become the better storage option for grids. An efficient battery is superior than using surplus energy to produce hydrogen from water. There doesn't appear to be a fundamental limit for batteries especially as graphene-based batteries are on the horizon. With hydrogen electrolysis is stuck. We can make phenomenally efficient fuel cells but the fuel is the sticking problem. 

What I want to know is where can hydrogen out perform electric batteries? What advantage does hydrogen have that would make it promising as an energy storage system?

t3_i4c4ej	CMV:Exploration of Mars and other planets is waste of money and time	"1. It is pointless. There is not a single planet or moon in solar system that is even remotely habitable. Mars has like 1/3 of Earth's gravity, extremely cold, and has no magnetic field to shield from radiation. Even if there was a way to fix these problems we won't have technology of that level for the next 100 years if not more. I won't even talk about other planets as they have even more extreme environments.

2. It is waste of resources. With our current ways of getting into space we spend enormous amount of resources. It gets even more expensive further we travel. Instead we can use those resources to research tech that will give us more immediate benefits and also long term - e.g: cleaning space trash, asteroid mining, skyhook, aerospike or maybe even completely new type of engine. These things are far more useful in close future than some research on another planets on where we will never live. 

3. A little off topic point. Earthly problems are always going to be an obstacle of making any substantial advancements in space exploration. We won't be making any permanent colonies anywhere outside of earth since it requires resources of entire planet to make it work (thus it requires unity of all humans)"	1	
t3_1madl0	I believe American Exceptionalism still exists. CMV	"Disclosure: I live in the USA, have for my entire life, though I have visited European countries, but no longer than 1 month.

Not quite a a response to Putin's letter today, but as a challenge to the view that American Exceptionalism no longer exists, I would like to offer a few of the beliefs I hold that shape my view. NONE of these points i raise are intended to imply that America is the only nation capable of these things, but taken together, as a group, serve as ample evidence that the USA is rather exceptional. I am not debating that Americans, individually are better than anyone.

1. The world pays attention to our presidential elections more so than any other country in the world. Our President selects his cabinet, drafts bills, and affects foreign policy so much so that it is an event the world has to follow. In addition, we hold a permanent seat on the UN security council.

2. Our financial markets drive the world economy. I am aware that emerging markets (China, Brazil, India, Russia) may in the future change that, but as it stands now, the US is the financial hub. The NYSE and NASDAQ exchanges are where the largest companies in the world are traded and are the most closely followed. One can also argue that without the collapses of Lehman Brothers, Freddie/Fannie etc., the world recession would have been far less severe. My point is  here that as the US markets go, so goes the majority of the world's markets.

3. Our military has the ability to do what others do not. Although we have not used an atomic bomb since WW2, we are one of the few nations on the earth who are allowed to have them, and we have a lot. Our military is massive enough to influence major foreign policy decisions, and is usually the military counted on to intervene in situations where others (alone) would not. The syrian rebels are asking for the Americans to intervene, and not (by name) other western powers (to my knowledge). That is enough to say to me that when assistance is required from abroad, we are the first those seeking it turn to, whether supported by the public or not. 

4. Hollywood. Perhaps less of a direct influence than the other stated points, but american media is consumed all over the world. Our stars are the biggest. For example, Michael Jordan. I am willing to entertain that popularity of soccer stars or celebrities from other nations are perhaps the biggest in the world, but as a whole i believe Hollywood has the biggest stars in the world. As long as our media is consumed on the level it is globally, american media is relevant to this conversation. 

In summation I believe that America as a nation still holds the power to influence the globe in a way that no other nation, on its own, can. The decisions made in Washington and on wall street send ripples felt around the world that have major influence a demand response. We are major drivers or world trade, technological innovation, entertainment and diplomacy. Individually, we are not any more special than any other citizen of the world, but as a nation,  i believe we are capable of things nobody else is, and that is rather exeptional"	1	
t3_92x0h7	CMV: Google will be the most dominant tech firm for the next 50 years	"I hold this view because Google own YouTube, Maps, Gmail, Chrome, Android, 85k of the world's smartest people working for them. How are they not going to be the dominant force for years to come?

They also own Waymo, which is regarded as the self driving car tech of the future, as well as google translate. 

Initially I was going to pose this as 'be the first company to a market cap of $1 trillion' but they could easily be beaten by Amazon et al, but that doesn't take away from the notion that long term they are going to dominate

What may change my view is some notion of disruptive technology, or legislation that may prevent their rise, but as an investment opportunity it seems very solid...which means I am even more inclined to have my view changed, because that is a dangerously dogmatic view from which to make an investment!

For the sake of discussion, I'm limiting the scope of overpopulation to the United States. We have a *lot* of people here, and a tragic percentage of our population lives in poverty, and it's only getting worse.

America simply feels busier and more frantic than it used to. Have you been in a modern popular American city lately? Holy shit; where did all these people come from?

t3_23ky5s	CMV: Crayon sharpeners are a huge scam!	"Let's start the week on a lighthearted note!

I have had the opportunity to see more children's programming recently, and I've noticed that Crayola has a lot of ""waste your art supplies"" products now.  Smash your crayons and melt them into molds! Use your markers to power a airbrush! Then it hit me - I'm just as much of a sap as the kids that fall for these things. When I was little, I remember *demanding* the box of crayons with the sharpener on the back. Why would anyone need to sharpen a crayon? There isn't any wood or anything - it's all wax. Even if you needed a sharper point, you can wear it down into the shape you need. The crayon sharpener is just there to encourage kids to waste their crayons, and make some fairly unpleasant multicolor dust.

So, am I a huge sucker, or can someone change my view?

t3_4awrva	CMV: The Indonesian forest fires are a crime against humanity and warrant international intervention.	"The annual forest fires in Indonesia (deliberately set for the purpose of clearing land for palm oil production) have worsened to the point that by some measures they uselessly release more carbon than does the entire US manufacturing sector. Notably this is carbon from peat coal accumulated over staggering stretches of time. Peat fires are notoriously difficult to extinguish with conventional means, and in some senses never fully stop burning. 

In addition to the direct threat that the smoke from these fires poses to countless persons’ health in the region, the ecological disaster that the Indonesian fires pose (at a time when control of greenhouse gas emissions is crucial) is in my view tantamount to a criminal act of global proportions. As such it is my view that these fires warrant as much (if not more) international concern and action as does ongoing genocide or nuclear programs run by unstable regimes.

Indonesia appears helpless to stop these fires and those that cause them. I hold that this is a global concern, and so global powers should intervene.

t3_bkfe7f	CMV: I think that it's not important that I probably won't be remembered hundreds of years later.	"Some people think that their life has no meaning because they won't be remembered in hundreds of years in the future. I don't think so. I don't think that being remembered is important.

Firstly, after hundreds of years passed, I'd be dead. Since I would be dead, I won't be around to experience anything. Therefore, things that happen hundreds of years in the future has no bearing on my current life. Therefore, it's not important to me.

Secondly, there are far more important things to worry about. Right now we are dealing with issues such as global warming, antibiotic resistance, possibility of nuclear war, etc. Those are all far more important than wanting to be remembered hundreds of years in the future.

Finally, it seems a bit selfish for me to worry about whether or not I will be remembered hundreds of years later. I mean, why does everything have to be about me? There are 7 billion people alive today, not everyone can be remembered hundreds of years later. Why do I deserve to be remembered more than anyone else?"	1	
t3_25mwam	CMV: The Russian incursion on the Crimea is not an indicator of WW3	"I've been reading an awful lot of doomsday posts on the subject. Even though the past two world wars have been more or less triggered by instability in east Europe and the Balkans times have changed and with the advent of the united nations and increased communications through the internet and other media make another world war unlikely. with special emphasis that the economic and political ties in the European, the international trade links between east and west discourage and impede the spread of war on a global scale. in addition to these factors that drove the third Reich and the kaisers of Germany to invade and annex is gone as empire by conquest in now politically frowned upon rather than necessary. the old alliance system is also now Less impacting then it was. aside from the ""special friendship"" between the united states and the united kingdom and a few others are now less impacting and that makes the prospect of chains of countries slipping over the brink to war is unlikely. in addition to this any war, invasion or even international dispute  (however minor) is passed through the U.N which have the political weight that the league of nations did not (allowing for greater international relation and resolution of conflict). the internet has also brought the increased awareness of conflict and so people can now inform themselves and protest more efficiently. finally nuclear weaponry. world leaders (Putin included) know that a prolonged world war will almost certainly end in another hiroshima/nagasaki bombing. though this time (as demonstrated by the cold war) many countries have nuclear weaponry and will use them  if needed too defend sovereignty and its own people.  as Einstein said “I know not with what weapons World War III will be fought, but World War IV will be fought with sticks and stones.” the prospect of total global annihilation is enough to put all but the most deranged of leaders and therefore makes world war three from somehthing like the Ukrainian conflict nigh on impossible"	1	
t3_2dbeo8	CMV:Overpopulation is a big problem in the world right now. Less people will make it a better world.	"There are many problems in this world and the first few that came up to mind were poverty, hunger, and joblessness. Now when thinking about these problems, I came to the conclusion that they were caused by two main reasons:
1. People are naturally greedy
2. There is too much competition in this world

Now, problem 1 is hard to fix. That is up to the individual and there will always be people that take advantage of others. 
However, thinking of problem 2, it came to me that if there were less people in the world, it would reduce competition and in the end help reduce poverty, hunger, and joblessness. 

With less people, less competition. Therefore, less threats and more security, leading to happier and more productive people. 

Now as how to fix the problem of overpopulation... this is the part I have doubts about. Advocating for less children and educating people about birth control won't really solve the problem. Government initiatives for families to have less children has proven to not work as well either. 

How about we reject the poor and people that don't contribute to society out of that society. Society is a network so if one doesn't contribute, one should not gain from the benefits. Social Darwinism, survival of the fittest. It naturally occurs in nature so why shouldn't it in society. 

Overpopulation is a sensitive problem difficult to solve. This post may sound extreme, backwards, and crude. I do believe in what I wrote to an extent but I did exaggerate to induce strong opposition. I do have a soft spot that says people should be given a second chance and that homeless should have natural rights just as we do. Some are not they because they don't work but because they can't or they made one simple mistake. I understand. However, having a side of me that says we should get rid of these people irritates me. 

So, change my view. 
Change my view that either:
1. Overpopulation is not such a severe problem in this world and has nothing to do with competition, greed, hunger, poverty, and joblessness.
2. There is an effective alternative solution to fix the problem of overpopulation. 
3. There is a more fundamental, or significant problem that needs to be taken care of in this world.

Change my view please. Thank you.

I understand people want to 'raise awareness', and I suppose that can be successful to an extent. But let's say a large group of people are marching through the streets to convince people's that climate change is a problem. Out of the people that actually see them or hear about them, many would hold the same view as them already, and don't need convincing. Out of the rest, a handful would be interested enough to look into the issue further, and some of those would make a small change to their beliefs and/or lifestyle. Of course if the rally is large enough it will get media coverage, and may be noticed by politicians, but let's be honest, they won't do anything useful either."	1	
t3_1unlde	I believe that it is pointless to excessively give to charity because the world's governments could easily solve the majority of problems charities aim to fix. CMV	"I've been thinking about this for a while now and only just found the desire to share it. Basically, I was thinking of how all the money donated by people over the years to charity hasn't had a huge impact on the world. Sure its changed small pockets of countries, but on a macro scale it really hasn't *solved* anything. As a preface, I do want to say that I give to charity occasionally with the intention of helping, but have become less enthused the more I give.

My main thoughts are aimed towards charities like Oxfam, Save the Children, ActionAid etc. that aim to end world poverty. Ignoring how much actually goes towards the cause (as opposed to being spent on admin. and marketing stuff) I don't think they're any closer to ending it. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation are doing wonderful things, but nothing that couldn't be done by governments in half the time and with significant ease.

If the main governments of the world (U.S., Canada, EU) worked together, they could easily cancel Africa's debt, blow billions, and make a bigger dent in the problems faced. The only thing that's stopping them is that they don't want to (although this is another argument altogether, shouldn't they stop spending money on stupid wars and allocate them elsewhere etc.). 

Overall, the public giving to charities isn't pointless, but I just don't see why we're giving so much into the bottomless pit of charity when it should be the government's responsibility (and well within their limits) to fix world poverty, world disease etc. CMV

t3_5w7onp	CMV: I believe that humanity is doomed and there isn't much we can do to stop it.	"I've been thinking about this the past couple of days. Although I usually like to think I'm an optimist, I can't help but feel a little pessimistic as I see the world crashing around me. Here are the reasons why I believe humanity won't last another century:

1) Society's reaction to politics: I'd rather not delve into the world of politics as we all know the terrible state of affairs right now. Instead of looking at Trump and discussing issues related to his presidency, I'd like to focus on the reaction that his presidency has garnered from the people. Never have I seen a more divided state of affairs in our country. I've seen friends, families, and even couples torn apart by political differences. I'm beginning to see a society that claims it support everyone's right to have an opinion, yet has no respect for others' opinions. The left and right have become so extreme, and the majority of independents in the country are lost and don't know which side to pick. How will such a fractured society recover from this?

2) Climate Change: I honestly have no hope that humanity will be able to stop climate change from endangering us as a species. First of all, legislation to cut CO2 emissions is far from being reality. Even if it was, it's my understanding that other greenhouse gases such as Methane pose an even worse threat. Even though it doesn't linger in the atmosphere as long as CO2, Methane is 84 times as potent as Carbon Dioxide and is very effective at absorbing heat. How will we resolve this? I see no talk of taking measures such as banning red meat and even if there was talk of such a thing, it's doubtful to get enough support from a country that relies on red meat for so many of its meals. 

Even if the United States hypothetically cut all of its CO2 and Methane emissions, who's to stop China from polluting the world into extinction? Also, I've heard a general consensus from many that scientists say it's too late to reverse the effects of climate change, does anyone have a source on this?

3) Disappearing Middle Class: Regardless of whether you are conservative, liberal, or independent, there's no denying the middle class is vanishing but I don't find many viable ways of saving it. 

4) Technology: Maybe I've been watching too much Black Mirror, but I feel that technology is going to destroy us by the end of the century. We already are facing the onset of the social complications that avoidant distractions such as social media places on us. I luckily grew up without having a cell phone as a crutch to help me avoid social interaction, but how will the next generation be able to socialize with an even larger variety of distractions available to them? Once new innovations such as VR find a commonplace in society, how will people find the will to get out and live their lives instead of just spending eternity in a virtual world where everything is perfect?

Furthermore, I feel that the next generation will grow up with absolutely no sense of privacy. We already know that governments around the world are obsessed with collecting data. Private corporations are also in the business of collecting users' private data. 

Once such data is compromised by hackers, totalitarian governments, or any other threatening entity, how can users trust that their data is secure? This would mean a complete eradication of privacy. I won't go into details, but anyone can quickly discover that everything you watch, say, or do on the internet is logged on a database somewhere that can be accessed in the future, leaving no room for privacy if said databases are compromised.

What scares me even more about technology is its eventual effect that it will have on the economy. Elon Musk claims that humanity will need a universal basic income in the future considering that a huge portion of jobs held by people across the globe will be taken by automated machines and even artificial intelligence. At what point will any jobs be left for people to fill in for? If the top 1% that owns factories that are operated by automated machinery then must pay a share of their earnings in order to pay for said universal income, how would an economy in which producers pay non-working consumers to buy the producers' products work? How would the fundamental concept of running an economy with jobs even sustain such damage?

5) Art: For me, 2016 has been one of the worst years for entertainment. It seems that Hollywood is being taken over by corporate investors that want to milk the industry for profit by using proven formulas that guarantee return of investment. The overwhelming amount of cookie cutter superhero movies in the past decade is terrifying considering that the vast majority of people still consume these manufactured pieces of ""art.""

At a certain point, people will get tired of the ""wash, rinse, repeat"" methodology circling through entertainment right now. The music industry also might face these problems, although my knowledge of this industry is not as vast.

What worries me especially is the fact that Hollywood will be bought out by China in the next 20 years. At that point, we will see films produced, bought, and distributed by foreign investors who will definitely seek to invest in other genre cycles to maximize profit. Directors will have no control over the final product and consumers will have less to choose from.

How will art survive in a world that insists on turning art into a product with no intention of experimentation or artistic freedom? If all art is eventually constructed based on a proven formula to generate profit for studios and record companies, is it even art?

6) Overpopulation: There is no doubt that we have already exceeded Earth's carrying capacity. We already have seen environmental issues caused by human intervention, but how are we going to be able to provide resources for a population that never stops growing?


The sad thing is I am only 19 and I am terrified of the future. My generation may make it, but I worry for the generations below me that society, government, technology, art, overpopulation, and Earth itself may prop up challenges that the generations to come may not have the capacity to take on.

I hope someone can prove me wrong here, but does anyone else feel the same way about any of these issues?"	1	
t3_5amo2n	CMV: The transition to a more ecological economy is worth the short-term costs in the long run.	"Alright, so recently we've been seeing a lot of politicians stating that global warming is a real problem but they don't think we should enact policy to start the transition to a greener economy. Either they say that it costs too much, that business (Oil companies) will be hurt and therefore the economy at large will perform poorly, or that we'll lose jobs because companies that hurt the environment will leave and jobs will be lost.


I however believe, despite the consequences of major reform to industry to make it greener, we'll end up better in the long run. Here are my reasons:


1. Global Warming is speeding up and won't decline unless action is taken to prevent it's current trajectory. We could find ourselves in a completely changed world in 50 years in terms of rising seas, ecological migration, and decreased livability in regions such as North Africa, which is currently the most sensitive area to global warming.

2. A more ecological economy will create new qualified jobs that will make up for the job losses in the coal/oil/natural gas industry. These jobs are higher paying and might lead to a growth of median household income for millions of families. Which leads to higher consumption and therefore a growth of demand in the economy at large.

3. Less dependence on oil and less influence of oil on international markets. Currently the USA is the second largest consumer of oil in the world, the cost to the taxpayer in subsidies in enormous and would be better spent on green energy subsidies.

t3_n6w840	CMV: Corporate Failures underline the AI alignment problem	"My main thesis statement can be put thusly:

**The ""alignment problem"" in advanced AI becomes extremely obvious when looking at corporate behavior in the 21st century, because corporations _already_ have an alignment problem.**


For those not in the know, the ""alignment problem"" in AI research basically boils down to this: if you manage to create some form of self-improving AI superintelligence, its intelligence alone will not force it to take on human values. Therefore a significant part of the problem with programming such an AI is finding ways to ""align"" its goals and incentives with humanity. The classic example of this failing is an AI whose goal is to make as many paperclips as possible and who proceeds to do this by creating nanomachines that transform all available material (including, say, the iron in bridges, electronic devices, and _your blood_) to paperclips. 

This is _not_ a trivial problem. Designing an unthinking mind that can modify itself with a goal that, given potentially infinite power and resources, _won't_ destroy humanity... That's legitimately hard. You might disagree with this... But I think that corporations make for an excellent argument as to why the AI alignment problem deserves to be taken seriously: because we've _failed_ to align corporations, in a way that already poses an unacceptable risk to humanity.

Corporations are, in a few notable ways, similar to AI. They are complex, developing systems that constantly change and rework themselves, with a clearly defined goal - profit. They are often located in a system of intense competition where those who are out-competed are destroyed. And while there are individual people within corporations, their individual morals or ideas are often completely subsumed by the role they take within that corporation. 

The most obvious and substantial example of corporate misalignment can be found within the oil industry. Climate change is an existential risk to human civilization, and [oil executives knew about this back in the 70s](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/exxon-knew-about-climate-change-almost-40-years-ago/). Instead of acknowledging this and trying to reform the business around something more sustainable, they spent billions of dollars spreading fear, uncertainty, and doubt about the science. 

Giving them as much benefit of the doubt as I possibly can, they were stuck in a position where their options were ""lie and eventually destroy humanity"" or ""tell the truth and immediately make the company fundamentally unworkable"", and if they chose the latter, they would be replaced by someone who would have chosen the option that means more profit\*. But regardless of why, various executives at various fossil fuel companies decided that the best plan of action was... to lie. To spend decades lying about the science so that they could continue to make money. 

I think this forms a chilling parallel to worries about AI and AI alignment. We have failed to correctly align corporations, and essentially built ourselves an ""artificial intelligence"" that is destroying our world, with surprisingly little human input in the process. Building an _actual_ AI, one that is capable of improving itself and redesigning itself to become more intelligent or capable, seems to pose a far harder challenge than the one we have utterly failed at. 

Change my View. :)

t3_6cml7j	"CMV: ""Nuclear Deterrence"" is fundamentally flawed and will lead to our extinction within the next 100 years"	"So my understanding is that: ""No country would ever mount a serious military assault against a nuclear power because they know that their adversary has the power to atomize them at the flick of a switch."" ...And this seemingly works both ways; if 2 nuclear powers have a disagreement they will not go to war as this essentially guarantees the complete destruction of the both of them.

Before I continue, one assumption that I'm going to write under is that in the event of one country launching a nuclear assault on another nuclear power - the power under attack will immediately respond with their own nuclear assault. Due to the fact that it's estimated that it would only take detonation of 0.1% (read somewhere on reddit, may be wrong) of earth's nuclear arsenal to render the planet essentially uninhabitable - I'm also going to assume that any nuclear war between nuclear powers essentially means the end of humanity.

---

So on to my issues with the theory. Firstly, it assumes that all nuclear powers are controlled by fully rational, reasonable, conflict averse people. As we can see in the modern world, this is simply not the case. For example: North Korea, Donald Trump, nuclear powers in the middle east... With the advancement of technology, nukes will become more and more available, to the point where we will have hundreds/thousands of people with the theoretical capability to push that button.

Secondly, even with nukes there may well still be ways for one country to cleanly demolish another nuclear power. A surprise pre-emptive strike against all of a countries nuclear capabilities would render their nuclear deterrent redundant. Under threat of nuclear assault with no nuclear defense, they would be completely at the mercy of their attacker.

Third, people may use the lack of world conflicts since the Cold War as evidence that nuclear deterrence is working. I refute this completely. It's not even been a century yet and the world is already in an extremely volatile and tense state. Furthermore, even in the Cold War, with all deterrence in full swing, [we were one single man's vote away from all out nuclear war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vasili_Arkhipov). 

---

**To conclude:** within the next century we will see a major global conflict, nuclear deterrence will fail, nukes will be fired by all sides, millions will die immediately with the rest of humanity condemned to perish on a now inhospitable planet. It's a depressing thought and I'd honestly love to have my mind changed.

t3_9p3ow1	"CMV: Partisan gridlock is a permanent and inherent feature of American politics, and nothing we can do will change it, short of changing the constitution"	"It seems that since at least the 80's, we've been stuck in a state of permanent partisan gridlock, and only when there are large majorities of either party and/or all branches of government are controlled by one party can substantial work be done.  So I believe that only if we change our system of government, to something where compromise is necessary and encouraged (how exactly, I don't know) can we end the partisanship we see today.  How am I wrong, and what can we do to change things without totally changing government?"	1	
t3_28hmrg	CMV: The Narrative around Climate Changed Has Poisoned the Well and Will Prevent Any Action to Stop It.	"I was talking to a friend of mine and an interesting point came up on the topic of climate change. We both believe in it but were discussing if we thought any decisive action would be taken.

I think one of the worst things that could have happened came to pass: it became a partisan political issue. Ignoring the issue is bad for everyone except oil companies in the short term. It will damage business just as much as individuals.

It could have been an issue with broad spectrum support. The fact that it became associated with left wing ideas is unfortunate in my opinion. Often times the message of stop global warming is mixed in with getting rid of capitalism or anti-globalization/anti-technology messages. Nobody on right would ever go along with that. I've seen people who believe that global warming is real but would still vote against change for political reasons [anti-big-government, pro-capitalism, anti-left].

I think a lot of good could be done with slow sweeping changes of both technology and infrastructure+energy policy; but everyone needs to take part. So CMV, prove that politicizing the issue has done good rather then harm.

t3_3ahcft	CMV: I see absolutely no point in engaging in racial discussions when we're faced with extinction as is.	"This isn't my view, but rather a friends. I just need more ammo to fire back it him. Here is how the conversation has gone so far. 

Him: i find it strange that people think there's hope we'll overcome racial barriers when the earth is literally facing an extinction event and people still refuse to believe that's even happening. 

Call me pessimistic on this one, but I don't believe hope is an option if humanity chooses to call climate change fate more than it cares to admit its our fault and clean it up. I mean, scientists have proposed legit ideas to straighten our climate out and we dont even care to throw the couple billions of dollars it would cost their way to even try it. whereas this racial tension stuff? no one even has the slightest clue on how to fix it.

Today
Me:
9:37pm
Me:
That's their whole plann, everything integrated on your xbox, pc, and phone. It's sort of like that now with win8 and it already works really well
Education is a big part of how to fix it


9:40pm
Him:
Education only works for the minds of those who want to be educated. 
Unfortunately, I can tell just based on climate change alone how well people react to being educated - and it's not good.

Him:
9:43pm
Him:
Take me for instance, I am decently educated - but I see absolutely no point in engaging in racial discussions when we're faced with extinction as is. 
Race won't matter when we're all dead, so dealing with it now doesn't matter. 
That's simply cold logic at work. What sense does it make to overcome our differences if we're all gonna wind up the same dead?

Me:
10:41pm
Me:
Most of the change won't happen now, kids need to be educated so the next generation is smarter. 
Just because extinction is coming in a couple hundred years is a stupid reason to not try to fix racism. Even with out mass extinction we're all going to die either way, might as well live in peace while we're still here. The less racism, homophobia, discrimination of any kind is better for humanity as a whole because it helps us to work towards a common goal easier than if we are divided. That's not cold logic, that's just dumb and counterproductive

Him:
10:44pm
Him:
I disagree. If we worked together for a common goal now, we would settle differences at the same time.
Him:

10:46pm
Him:
So, it makes sense to put our focus on that which is the most threatening, in this case climate change. 
If we waste time debating social injustices and deciding who's right and who's wrong, it will only lead to spurious debates whose wanted outcomes would change for the better with each new generation just based on evolution itself. The further away from our primitives selves we get, the less violent we become - and that is precisely why crime rates go down over time. 

That is not due to generations coming together and deciding peace is the best way, it is literally due to evolution - which dictates that less violence means a stronger living species.

Him:
10:47pm
Him:
So, in terms of climate change, we have literally run out of time. We either act now, or it's too late - and what with everyone bitching about sexism and racism, it's too late.

Him:
10:49pm

Him:
Our future is cemented, humanity will go extinct, and to me, that means overcoming obstacles is a gigantic waste of time. Most notably because, it will happen over time regardless of the discussions we have, and, by the time it is finally realized, we won't have much of a future left to enjoy it anyways. 
It's like asking people to come together and work towards this magnificent goal, for literally zero reward.

Him:
11:10pm
Him:
Also, just an addition, how do you think humanity will respond to staring at its own extinction? Do you think they'll be like, well at least we set aside our differences, or do you think people will start killing each other over loaves of bread?
Just saying, any amount of damage we could undo in that amount of time will be undone by facing extinction. So, if we could extend that by a hundred thousand years, then yeah it would be well worth it to overcome them as quickly as possible. But at a couple thousand years left, it simply isn't worth putting more energy into than necessary. 
That's not to say I believe inequality should stay around longer, I would much rather everyone were equal - but the fact that humanity thinks itself so important that its needs come before the planet's is disturbing. I should like to think I'd have these thoughts if my skin were any color other than white - but since it is I know this opinion will get shot to shit.

t3_270b3g	CMV: Large capital investments like the World Cup & Olympics are an excellent way to stimulate Brazil's economy	"Contrary to the popular zero-sum notion of government spending that pits spending money on the World Cup and/or Olympic Games in Brazil is amoral while there is abject poverty nearby, I think that successful activities on a world stage are an excellent way to stimulate long term economic growth. This is the old give a Brazilian dinner and you feed him for a day. Give him an globalized economy that creates jobs and wealth and he can feed himself for the rest of his life.

If you subscribe to Keynesian economics, then you should support Brazil's decision to host the World Cup and Olympic Games. Not only is there a direct economic stimulus from the infrastructure and games himself, but the global attention could very well result in global investment.

In the long-term, that means a stronger Brazilian economy, which means less poverty.

t3_3q89hc	CMV: Neoliberal globalization actually isn't a bad thing for the global poor	"By ""neoliberal globalization,"" I mean the trends over the past 40 years or so that have scaled back the role of governments in the economy (i.e. deregulation of markets, trade liberalization, limiting of social programs).

I always thought that these trends were negatively affecting poor people, especially in the Global South, but I am starting to have my doubts. Of course, specific neoliberal reforms do have negative consequences for poor people in specific contexts, but I am interested in the effect of neoliberalism in general. 

How could it be that neoliberal globalization is negatively affecting the poor when global poverty has been declining at a considerable rate for the past 40 years? Obviously, correlation does not equal causation, but what are the confounding variables responsible for the decline in poverty? I have a hard time believing that the global community is doing so much for poor people around the world that we have been able to reduce poverty considerably despite simultaneously enacting policies that undermine our efforts.

Please CMV! Also, reading recommendations would be appreciated!

t3_2h57pa	"CMV: Income Inequality, Stagnation & High Tuition Costs Are NOT ""Good"" Things"	"Hi All,

My default position and I suspect most redditors, if not Westerners, is that wage stagnation, the increase in inequality & high university/college etc. costs are BAD things. 
[For me] 
It is obvious that all three are damaging to the social fabric of a country in countless ways; though for simplicity I will try to pick a couple for each mentioned. 

Inequality:  
*Creating in wealthier folks a chillier disposition to their fellow man
*Subverting equality under the law---as money buys relatively more ability to evade laws & penalties.
*Pushing ""poverty mindset"" onto more people, who then even if ""materially satisfied"", have a great deal less ""mental bandwidth"" to make long term choices etc.  

Stagnation:
*Increases inequality, what wage gains are made must go to those with more power, who come to see all interactions with poorer people as zero sum
*Reduces hope (motivation) for lower classes, decreasing productivity & self-investment.

Tuition Increase:
*Raising cost of credentialing, decreases ability of population to ""get ahead"" in their career or field etc.
*Limiting future productivity gains made from a more educated workforce.
*Disincentive for Learning: why risk your expensive degree (possible ticket out of poverty) on difficult subject matter? 
*Government Costs Increase: more grants etc. more subsidized loans.
(We spend more on programs to get people to school than we would if we guaranteed some variant of free schooling etc.)



However, it is NOT obvious, that because we perceive these to be bad things, they are BAD things. These could be both are natural AND/OR desirable side-effects of the world we want to live in. 


1) Globalization & Tech:
We live in a massively unfair world. Westerners are have far greater access to wealth and resources than the Third World. This disparity facilitates growth in low-income countries and proliferation of cheap goods in the West. Obviously, it will put downward pressure on wages in the West, through offshoring, immigration etc. 
Little child workers make the iPhone [or insert beloved electronic toy] possible and their labor reduces WORLD income inequality.
(I assume most redditors believe less World inequality is good, if not computers, phones etc.)


2) Climate Change: 
We live in a massively unfair world. The Global South will be hit far worse than the developed countries by climate disasters---even though we have the larger carbon foot print. Should every American be able to afford a car and gas at the 90s price of $1/gallon? Maybe if everything is more expensive, we will be forced to be more efficient in our consumption of carbon etc. If the Global South is a little richer, they might be better placed to handle coming catastrophes or at least feel less resentment/rage towards the developed world because they were active participants and not imperial victims.


3) Governance: 
How do you keep affluent, entitled humans (won't say ignorant because we are all human) from rebelling or fomenting dissent? Wages must go down, but services & motivation among populace must be maintained. If wages go down, younger people will work for less. They will demand less, because they will have more to do. They can also decrease labor costs in government offices etc. 
Tuition increases can be helped with government loans, which provide permanent income stream to government in place of unpopular tax increases etc. 
This gets enough kids degrees and economic churn and keeps services running. 
And maybe less education---in the way of ""critical thinking"" or creativity is not a bad thing, is your society has ""enough"" of it.



I strongly feel much of the time, that the way we all live is ass-backwards and I suspect many *privileged* humans like me do too. We could develop poor countries without inhuman labor conditions. A lot of carbon, energy and human capital is spent unproductively, for ex. driving to and from work, making existing tech obsolete for no reason (see MS Office Suite, Pre-Micro USB phones etc. etc.)
Instead we have this weird game set-up where we find excuses to inflict psychological pain on our fellow citizens, ""You don't have enough skills and therefore you should be unemployed and why are you unemployed? Have you no moral center?"" 



I realize this post is complicated and no one wants to make the 'pro-misery' argument. 
I also acknowledge the attraction to fallacious ""hard truths"". (see subscriber count to r/redpill)



So CMV: 

National Inequality, Wage Stagnation & Tuition Increases are NOT desirable consequences of the challenges of globalization, climate change and improvement in technology. They are NOT good things that curb Western excesses (like driving, flying on airplanes) while keeping the whole structure of government services and larger economy functioning. 


Thanks for your criticisms.

t3_3yr4pw	"CMV: Kid A gets $10 a day, then $100 on 10th birthday. Kid B gets $100 a day, then $100 on 10th birthday. I think Kid 1 is happier at the end."	"Hi Reddit, 
I'm not sure how to put my view in a general sense, so I think a analogy will be the best way to describe it. 

**Analogy** There are two kids. Both get daily allowance. (spoiled kids right?) Anyways..

-  Kid A gets $10 a day.

-  Kid B gets $100 a day. 

On the 10th birthday, both kid A and kid B receive $100 instead of the normal allowance.

**I believe kid A will be the happier of the pair.**

*Reasoning:*

-  Kid A got an increase from the normal allowance, while kid B receive the same amount that is usually given.

-  It feels like a special day for kid A, but its just another day for kid B.

-  Kid A will appreciate money more than kid B.

My friend, however, feels the exact opposite as me. Obviously, kid B received more money than kid A in the long run. So my friend says that kid B is happier because kid B's whole life is feeling rich, but kid A only feels rich at 10th birthday. 

**What is the general view of people? Kid A is happier or Kid B is happier?**
