And therefore their claims can be challenged by the laymen far more easily.\\n\\nAlso there are many conflicting reports among the fields of study when it comes to subjects like economics and sociology. Both generally claim to study similar things, but economics finds that Black people are poor not because they are oppressed or because they are less efficient but because they started off poor and tend to remain poor, while sociology concludes that they must be oppressed at some point.\\n\\nSociology claims there is a patriarchy, while economics explains the wage gap as barely having anything to do with sexism and more to do with individualistic choices. \\n\\nHow can we both believe the experts of both of these fields when they come to opposite conclusions?\\n\\nAlthough economics most certainly does not support MRA's either.</td>\n",

       "      <td>I mostly agree with the first part of your argument, but there are a few things I'd urge you to consider:\\n\\n1. Hard scientific truths such as the Theory of Relativity are first derived by performing intense mathematical calculations which are based entirely on logical axioms. That is, if you want to prove something scientifically, you generally have to prove it mathematically first. If your proof for something involves 1+1 = 3, then your proof is faulty and cannot stand up to even basic scientific rigor. \\n\\n2. Hard scientific truths are further derived by rigorous and repeated experiments. In some physics labs, researchers often perform thousands of experiments per second in order to FULLY quantify their theories and provide accurate results and prove that statistical uncertainties did not affect their result. **It is insufficent to prove something is true, you must also prove that it is not false.**\\n\\nSo, Theory of gravity, Theory of Relativity, Theory of evolution, global warming, these are all scientific truths that have been subjected to intense scientific rigor in the community. Most, if not all experiments on these theories have produced EXACTLY the same result, give or take some negligible statistical error. You could perform some of these experiments in your backyard and get roughly the same result as a Harvard Researcher.\\n\\nHowever, the same cannot be said for soft sciences such as economics, sociology, anthropology, etc. While these disciplines provide a vital function in society, the scientific rigor for these is less stringent than it is for say, Nuclear Physics. \\n\\nAnother problem with this research is the simultaneous lack of and overflowing of data. Often, sociological research is satisfied with providing evidence of correlation and therefore proving causation. Also, the only way to gather non-demographic data is to perform interviews. As we know from hard scientific research, people don't always tell the truth in interviews, whether because people are unreliable or memory is unreliable or whatever the case may be. You can't trust first-person accounts.\\n\\n For example, you decide to do some sociological research. You interview 100 black people and, given the question: \"Have you experienced racial discrimination in your lifetime?\" 90 of them indicate that yes, they have experienced racial discrimination at some point in their life. Wow! According to your data and experiment, you have proven with 90% certainty that racism against black people is rampant in society.\\n\\nBut in the hard sciences, this sort of experiment would be ripped to shreds. You may have picked 100 people from a certain geographical region for starters. You may also have phrased your question is such a way that was confusing for the subjects. Additionally, the subjects may have interpreted the question in a different way than you intended, or they consider racial discrimination to include categories of behavior which you yourself would not include.\\n\\nI'd like to also point out that your entire argument is based on a logical fallacy known as \"[appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority),\" specifically in the context of deductive reasoning. The truth is, that even the experts in their field aren't necessarily correct in their assertions *even within their own field of expertise.* For an example of this, doctors have to be insured while practicing medicine. The reason for this, of course, even if we assume that the medical practitioner did everything in good faith and to the best of their ability, there is the very real possibility of human error. While sociologists and mathematicians do not face any particularly grave consequences for their mistakes, a doctor faces being responsible for the death of another human being. Ah, but if I were to seek a second or third opinion in your perfect world, I would be going against the expert wouldn't I?\\n\\nYour entire post seems to be a build up to the last section which is an attack on the credibility of the Men's Rights Movement. [For that, I only urge you to read this redditor's comment to a similar assertion.](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/1jt1u5/cmv_i_think_that_mens_rights_issues_are_the/cbi2m7a)</td>\n",

       "      <td>I didn't really see it mentioned here, but I thought perhaps I'd toss in some ideas why people might be logically against GMOs beyond the 'genetically modified' part.\\n\\nOne is that there are GMOs that are specifically designed to make a crop resistant to particular herbicides and pesticides. It encourages a lot of use, and possible overuse of the stuff, which while it itself might not be dangerous, misuse or leakages into water supplies wouldn't be what I call a good situation. Not really a huge fear, but it plays a lot into an overuse (or misuse) of land.\\n\\nGMOs also encourage monoculture, which is good for mass production of a particular crop, but bad for protecting a crop yield from failure or disease. A particular pest or mold comes in that really loves corn and isn't phased by spraying? There's a smorgasbord just waiting there for them. In fact, GMOs might encourage the cultivation of these pests or plant diseases, due to their sheer number. After all, evolution encourages changes and development that allows for something to take advantage of something in its environment. If a particular worm becomes resistant to a chemical being sprayed to keep it from the roots, or something in the roots themselves, and returns to devouring the crop, you end up with larger crop failures because of the amount of that homogeneous strain of crop are in the area. So it turns into an arms race to keep nature at bay with engineered science, instead of agricultural science (at the cost of precious crop output.)\\n\\nThis sort of farming also continues to 'support' crop subsidies. If there's a subsidy for a particular crop, why would you not grow X crop over a different crop? Why rotate crops when the price for corn is going to always have a minimum level and always provide you with a price guarantee? Why rotate crops to cycle your soil when you can simply spray more fertilizers down?\\n\\nSo the fear doesn't necessarily have to be directly due to GMO usage (which is probably more what you're talking about when people complain about GMOs, the change of genetics, not the agricultural process itself), but GMO usage itself could be encouraging what is essentially poor land management. People that have a big fear or criticism of big business management, would probably be very aggravated by the idea that the majority of cropland is being treated not like an upscale factory (with both energy and production efficiency weighed equally to produce a product.) but like an overseas sweatshop (production efficiency outweighing other factors.) I would imagine more of those are on the left side of the political spectrum.</td>\n",

I'm in favor of it, but it does produce waste that we don't really have a way to get rid of. The best idea we have is to make a very large hole in the ground, coat it in a lot of concrete, and put the waste in the hole until it breaks down into non-radioactive elements. There are alternative methods being developed, but they aren't ready for full implementation. Perhaps more importantly, no one wants one anywhere near their property. It's really difficult to build them.\\n\\nWind is a good one, but it's not constant. The great thing about coal is that it's there no matter what the weather is like. If it's just not a breezy day, you may not have enough power. Wind power gathered from over the ocean (and harnessing the power of waves) are more reliable, but that only helps anyone near enough to the coast. It's a great supplement, but it's not enough.\\n\\nSolar is a favorite as well. It suffers from the same fickleness as wind, but that's not my main problem with it. First off, it's really inefficient as it currently is. More efficient panels are also really expensive to build. Cheaper ones wear out very quickly. The technology is really in the development phase. They recently built a solar plant in Spain and by the time it was finished, it was already an obsolete model. It's great for early adopters who want to put panels on their houses, but it isn't ready for full-scale industrial use. \\n\\nAlso, a general problem with renewables is that they aren't consistent. Power demand follows a certain pattern throughout the day. Using coal you can turn plants on or off to meet demand. You can't do that with wind or solar. To solve this problem, we need better energy storage and that is nowhere near available for the levels we are talking about. \\n\\nTl;dr Your heart is in the right place, but there just isn't a solution ready to start fixing this tomorrow.</td>\n",

Whatever they use, as population and wealth grows, people will want to consume more energy, so even if the source is a bit cleaner than coal currently is, this can still be a problem. Also, there are some good reasons to think that [reducing consumption of meat](http://www.pbjcampaign.org/) is the most effective way to reduce climate-change-inducing pollution.\\n\\nThe point being, simply shutting down coal plants may be a good way to cut pollution, but it's not the best way. The best way would be to simply tax pollutants. This creates incentive for energy producers to find cleaner and more efficient ways to produce energy, regardless of whatever the method will be (and we can't predict ahead of time what those methods will be!). And it allows consumers to adjust their energy consumption in the way they each find least burdensome given each person's unique preferences, rather than forcing one way on everyone.

This same argument applies to economics.\\n\\nWhen it comes to subjects like sociology and economics the experts cannot do experiments and cannot know for certain, but they continue to frame their arguments as if they do know.\\n\\nWhile all of the other parts of your post cite scientists the last one does not. And therefore their claims can be challenged by the laymen far more easily.\\n\\nAlso there are many conflicting reports among the fields of study when it comes to subjects like economics and sociology. Both generally claim to study similar things, but economics finds that Black people are poor not because they are oppressed or because they are less efficient but because they started off poor and tend to remain poor, while sociology concludes that they must be oppressed at some point.\\n\\nSociology claims there is a patriarchy, while economics explains the wage gap as barely having anything to do with sexism and more to do with individualistic choices. \\n\\nHow can we both believe the experts of both of these fields when they come to opposite conclusions?\\n\\nAlthough economics most certainly does not support MRA's either.   \n",
       "14   I mostly agree with the first part of your argument, but there are a few things I'd urge you to consider:\\n\\n1. Hard scientific truths such as the Theory of Relativity are first derived by performing intense mathematical calculations which are based entirely on logical axioms. That is, if you want to prove something scientifically, you generally have to prove it mathematically first. If your proof for something involves 1+1 = 3, then your proof is faulty and cannot stand up to even basic scientific rigor. \\n\\n2. Hard scientific truths are further derived by rigorous and repeated experiments. In some physics labs, researchers often perform thousands of experiments per second in order to FULLY quantify their theories and provide accurate results and prove that statistical uncertainties did not affect their result. **It is insufficent to prove something is true, you must also prove that it is not false.**\\n\\nSo, Theory of gravity, Theory of Relativity, Theory of evolution, global warming, these are all scientific truths that have been subjected to intense scientific rigor in the community. Most, if not all experiments on these theories have produced EXACTLY the same result, give or take some negligible statistical error. You could perform some of these experiments in your backyard and get roughly the same result as a Harvard Researcher.\\n\\nHowever, the same cannot be said for soft sciences such as economics, sociology, anthropology, etc. While these disciplines provide a vital function in society, the scientific rigor for these is less stringent than it is for say, Nuclear Physics. \\n\\nAnother problem with this research is the simultaneous lack of and overflowing of data. Often, sociological research is satisfied with providing evidence of correlation and therefore proving causation. Also, the only way to gather non-demographic data is to perform interviews. As we know from hard scientific research, people don't always tell the truth in interviews, whether because people are unreliable or memory is unreliable or whatever the case may be. You can't trust first-person accounts.\\n\\n For example, you decide to do some sociological research. You interview 100 black people and, given the question: \"Have you experienced racial discrimination in your lifetime?\" 90 of them indicate that yes, they have experienced racial discrimination at some point in their life. Wow! According to your data and experiment, you have proven with 90% certainty that racism against black people is rampant in society.\\n\\nBut in the hard sciences, this sort of experiment would be ripped to shreds. You may have picked 100 people from a certain geographical region for starters. You may also have phrased your question is such a way that was confusing for the subjects. Additionally, the subjects may have interpreted the question in a different way than you intended, or they consider racial discrimination to include categories of behavior which you yourself would not include.\\n\\nI'd like to also point out that your entire argument is based on a logical fallacy known as \"[appeal to authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority),\" specifically in the context of deductive reasoning. The truth is, that even the experts in their field aren't necessarily correct in their assertions *even within their own field of expertise.* For an example of this, doctors have to be insured while practicing medicine. The reason for this, of course, even if we assume that the medical practitioner did everything in good faith and to the best of their ability, there is the very real possibility of human error. While sociologists and mathematicians do not face any particularly grave consequences for their mistakes, a doctor faces being responsible for the death of another human being. Ah, but if I were to seek a second or third opinion in your perfect world, I would be going against the expert wouldn't I?\\n\\nYour entire post seems to be a build up to the last section which is an attack on the credibility of the Men's Rights Movement.

There is no evidence of harm, so why overreact?  Let it do it’s thing, it’s helpful!\\n\\nWhile no doubt there may be some overreaction, the majority of skepticism about GM foods or \"GMO hysteria” as you put it is more about caution than hysteria.  \\n\\nAgriculture happens on a massive level. We are talking about [millions and millions of tons of food](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture#Crop_statistics).  I’m all for trying these things out on a small level over several decades to see how they might interact with endemic species, to see what happens regarding cross pollination, to see what eating things with merged genes might do over time.  We haven’t been in this world before... perhaps it’s best not to jump into it with millions and millions of tons of material.\\n\\nThere could be unintended consequences. Like what happened when we introduced [rabbits in australia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rabbits_in_Australia) or [africanized honey bees in brazil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Africanized_bee).  \\n\\nIt’s not the GMO food are necessarily bad, but can we just slow the heck down and make sure we aren’t opening a pandoras box?   \n",

It encourages a lot of use, and possible overuse of the stuff, which while it itself might not be dangerous, misuse or leakages into water supplies wouldn't be what I call a good situation. Not really a huge fear, but it plays a lot into an overuse (or misuse) of land.\\n\\nGMOs also encourage monoculture, which is good for mass production of a particular crop, but bad for protecting a crop yield from failure or disease. A particular pest or mold comes in that really loves corn and isn't phased by spraying? There's a smorgasbord just waiting there for them. In fact, GMOs might encourage the cultivation of these pests or plant diseases, due to their sheer number. After all, evolution encourages changes and development that allows for something to take advantage of something in its environment. If a particular worm becomes resistant to a chemical being sprayed to keep it from the roots, or something in the roots themselves, and returns to devouring the crop, you end up with larger crop failures because of the amount of that homogeneous strain of crop are in the area. So it turns into an arms race to keep nature at bay with engineered science, instead of agricultural science (at the cost of precious crop output.)\\n\\nThis sort of farming also continues to 'support' crop subsidies. If there's a subsidy for a particular crop, why would you not grow X crop over a different crop? Why rotate crops when the price for corn is going to always have a minimum level and always provide you with a price guarantee? Why rotate crops to cycle your soil when you can simply spray more fertilizers down?\\n\\nSo the fear doesn't necessarily have to be directly due to GMO usage (which is probably more what you're talking about when people complain about GMOs, the change of genetics, not the agricultural process itself), but GMO usage itself could be encouraging what is essentially poor land management. People that have a big fear or criticism of big business management, would probably be very aggravated by the idea that the majority of cropland is being treated not like an upscale factory (with both energy and production efficiency weighed equally to produce a product.) but like an overseas sweatshop (production efficiency outweighing other factors.) I would imagine more of those are on the left side of the political spectrum.   \n",

I don't know of anyone who voted for a democrat who is anti-GMO. Even better, one of them gets their *paychecks* from a Republican affiliated organization. (Chamber of Commerce).   \n",

I see plenty of GMO hysteria from the right. From what I see the right-wing problem is usually that \"genetically modified\" sounds scary. The left-wing problem is usually being scared of big agri-business, mostly Monsato. Here's a list of states considering GMO legislation: http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org/issues/976/ge-food-labeling/state-labeling-initiatives# It seems to have a good number of red, blue and purple states all mixed together. It generally doesn't seem to be strongly associated with either \"side\".\\n   \n",

I would have thought the left means more democrat, socialist and in the extreme communist tendencies, and the right is more free market, small government and in the extreme abolish welfare and each to their own.  How does the GMO craze fit into that scale, or is the scale wrong?   \n",

A movement towards local, sustainable farming done in mixed cultures (like a home garden, on a several acre plot) would usually make some level of genetic modification completely useless (you don't need to soak your plants in round-up).   \n",

However, I would argue we simply don't understand their implications on local and global ecosystems yet.   \n",

There's no transparency, and a lot of deception involved. People want to know what exactly they're eating.\\n\\nThat being said, I think GMOs hold some promise, and I'm NOT a blind hater of GMOs, but I do think more rigorous testing and more transparency is a must. A lot of the arguments against GMOs aren't ideological, as much as they are about legitimate issues like testing and transparency.   \n",

Yes, in retrospect, we shouldn't have relied so heavily on this particular source of energy, but that's the past, and making drastic changes \"immediately\" just isn't practical.     \n",

You are absolutely right. We should avoid using coal. But we need to keep the lights on. So how do you propose to do that?\\n\\nNuclear is a popular idea. I'm in favor of it, but it does produce waste that we don't really have a way to get rid of. The best idea we have is to make a very large hole in the ground, coat it in a lot of concrete, and put the waste in the hole until it breaks down into non-radioactive elements. There are alternative methods being developed, but they aren't ready for full implementation. Perhaps more importantly, no one wants one anywhere near their property. It's really difficult to build them.\\n\\nWind is a good one, but it's not constant. The great thing about coal is that it's there no matter what the weather is like. If it's just not a breezy day, you may not have enough power. Wind power gathered from over the ocean (and harnessing the power of waves) are more reliable, but that only helps anyone near enough to the coast. It's a great supplement, but it's not enough.\\n\\nSolar is a favorite as well. It suffers from the same fickleness as wind, but that's not my main problem with it. First off, it's really inefficient as it currently is. More efficient panels are also really expensive to build. Cheaper ones wear out very quickly. The technology is really in the development phase. They recently built a solar plant in Spain and by the time it was finished, it was already an obsolete model. It's great for early adopters who want to put panels on their houses, but it isn't ready for full-scale industrial use. \\n\\nAlso, a general problem with renewables is that they aren't consistent. Power demand follows a certain pattern throughout the day. Using coal you can turn plants on or off to meet demand. You can't do that with wind or solar. To solve this problem, we need better energy storage and that is nowhere near available for the levels we are talking about. \\n\\nTl;dr Your heart is in the right place, but there just isn't a solution ready to start fixing this tomorrow.    \n",

Or what if people just use power from oil-burning factories instead? Whatever they use, as population and wealth grows, people will want to consume more energy, so even if the source is a bit cleaner than coal currently is, this can still be a problem. Also, there are some good reasons to think that [reducing consumption of meat](http://www.pbjcampaign.org/) is the most effective way to reduce climate-change-inducing pollution.\\n\\nThe point being, simply shutting down coal plants may be a good way to cut pollution, but it's not the best way. The best way would be to simply tax pollutants. This creates incentive for energy producers to find cleaner and more efficient ways to produce energy, regardless of whatever the method will be (and we can't predict ahead of time what those methods will be!). And it allows consumers to adjust their energy consumption in the way they each find least burdensome given each person's unique preferences, rather than forcing one way on everyone.

We on reddit can throw around a hundred different articles, papers, and graphs, but to do this properly, I'd like to see at least one source that you used to get this opinion. That way, when we get to the nitty gritty of the scientific reasoning, we can target the specific parts of the theory of climate change that you see differently.   \n",

There's a difference of about a 100-fold in change. I'm not a climate scientist, but a 100 fold difference in change is a 100-fold less time for people to adapt and animals to evolve.\\n\\nMethane, nitrogen oxide, and carbon dioxide are the three big greenhouse gases we produce. [Here's the formula for how they heat the earth. ](http://i.imgur.com/540Ftxq.png).[Here's an explanation for how the math works. It's hard, and will take a while to understand completely.](http://www.realclimate.org/index.php/archives/2007/08/the-co2-problem-in-6-easy-steps/).\\n\\n[This is a chart on the change in the atmosphere.](http://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/climatescience/greenhousegases/industrialrevolution/_jcr_content/articleContent/columnbootstrap_2/column0/image.img.jpg/1374088243357.jpg). Dioxide is mispelled but the data is correct. If you want independent confirmation, google it.\\n\\n1900: Methane: 800 parts per million. Now: Methane:2000 parts per million. \\n\\n1900: Nitrogen Oxide: 900 parts per million. Now: Nitrogen Oxide: 1300 parts per million.\\n\\n1900: Carbon Dioxide: 900 parts per million. Now: 1900 parts per million. \\n\\nAs you can see, we've roughly doubled the amount of greenhouse gas. \\n\\n[This is the amount of global warming we've caused.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiative_forcing#mediaviewer/File:Radiative-forcings.svg) Again, you can check out all the data and formulas. It's simple physics. It's what we use to propel spacecraft and make sure they don't over heat.\\n\\nAccording to [this](http://www.mpoweruk.com/solar_power.htm), the earth receives an average of 342 Watts per metre. We, adding 1.5 watts per metre, increased the amount of energy the earth is receiving by 0.5%. \\n\\nThat's why we cause global warming. Someone qualified can tell you about the biological effects in scientific detail.   \n",

If the actions of people are changing the global climate then should not the government be responsible for setting the rules so that their own people are not acting on a global stage?   \n",
