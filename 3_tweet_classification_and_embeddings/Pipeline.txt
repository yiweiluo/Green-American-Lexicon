A. Replicate Koenecke and Felu-Fabà approach
    1. Compile list of influential tweeters on both sides--Done! (influential_tweeters.csv)
    2. Scrape all their tweets w/ Twint, constrain tweets to those with "global warming", "climate change", other keywords to get set of +1/-1 labeled tweets as Training--Done!
    3. Repeat 1.-2. as necessary to achieve balance in Training data--290k denying vs. 230k affirming

B. VSMs with new data
	1. Scraping--Done!
	2. Pre-processing: remove punctuation and clean, tokenization, lemmatization + stemming
	3. Train VSMs
	4. Similarity of terms in pro- and anti-cc VSMs to different concepts (“science”, “uncertainty”, “conspiracy”, “people”, “fear”, “hope”, “denial”, “backlash”) and concept lexicons
