I have started researching just how dire the climate situation is and am paralysed with dread.,"EDIT: thank you to everyone who has commented. You’ve given me perspective and some useful ideas to take action. I will be careful about over researching/ thinking critically about climate news. I am going to talk to someone about my anxiety.


I live in Australia. In the past six months alone, we have had: 

* more then a million dead fish floating in the Darling River in New South Wales.
* thousands of cattle drowned in flash-flooding in rural Queensland, leaving farmers who were crippled by the drought financially ruined and struggling to bury the bodies of their animals.
* the driest and hottest January in recorded history, 1.5 degrees above the national average. Every summer has been hotter then the last.

This is in Australia, an industrially developed country that’s rich enough to shelter the majority of its citizens from the realities of climate change. I’m just starting  to comprehend how the climate disaster has ravaged other countries.

  
I am so ashamed to admit that it took a catastrophe of these proportions to shake me out of my slumber and realise the apocalypse we’re gunning towards.

  
Over the last week, I have been doing all the research I can, and it’s slowly sinking in...

  
I found out that the biggest thing that you can do to increase your climate footprint is have kids. Having kids is something I’ve always wanted to do. I love kids. I flirt with different careers but I’ve always known I want to be a dad, a grandpa.  But how can I justify having children when adding to the population will only make their situation worse? How can I justify building a career, finding someone to love, having a family, when I can’t even guarantee that my family will survive to have children of their own? I’m grieving for children I haven’t even had yet. (I know there’s always adoption, and I wouldn’t need the kids I raise to be mine biologically, but adoption laws are really strict in Australia.) My friends have a little girl and I love her more then anything. What will her future be like? Will she have a future?

  
I want to run around screaming at everybody, “Wake up! Wake up! We can’t do this anymore! We need to stop this NOW!” I’m trying to tell my parents that we need to turn fans off, and  turn powerpoints off at the wall, and stop eating so much meat, and wasting food. I’m trying to tell them how scared I am and they tell me I’ve overreacting. I’m having anxiety attacks at work. I’m trying to work my way through existential dread on my lunchbreaks. I see my friends laughing and smiling and I try and joke with them, and sometimes I even forget for a little bit. I don’t want to tell them what I’m going through. I don’t want them to be scared like I am.

  
 And it’s so horrible because I’ve experienced anxiety before, and I’ve calmed myself down by telling myself the situation that I’m worried about might never come to pass. But I can’t do that. Because the thing I’m terrified of will happen. It’s been happening for years and it’s happening now. I should be scared. Everyone should be scared. I have to take beta blockers just to get through the day. What would happen if everyone came off their anxiety meds at once? Would there be riots in the streets? Would we stop pretending everything was business as usual? Would shit actually happen?

  
Even trying to distract myself just makes the problem worse. I drive the car to work and that puts gasses into the air. I try and play my PS4 to keep my mind off everything but that just uses more electricity and puts more carbon in the air. The computer I’m typing this on consumes electricity, and was probably assembled by a Chinese slave to boot.  I will be moving to a new city in a week’s time and that flight alone will pump a few thousand cubic metres of gasses that shouldn’t be there into the air. And I don’t even fly that much - I know people my age that fly to new countries every few months just to have something new to put on their fucking Instagram. How can I justify being alive? How can I justify all the resources I consume just by existing? How can any of us?  

Our government will not propose a remotely sustainable climate policy. Our current prime minister brings lumps of coal into parliament and shakes them around saying that we shouldn’t be scared of fossil fuels.  Our government ministers go to climate change meetings and make jokes about how rising sea levels will have people in our neighbouring, tiny island nations 'with water lapping at their ankles.’ The last prime minister to propose a carbon tax lost her job because of it. They did this to us. They don’t give a shit. And we did this to ourselves by continuing to vote them in. We do this to ourselves by pulling the wool over our eyes and continuing to live our lives as if nothing is happening when it clearly is. 

  
I’m trying to take action. I’m trying to phase red meat and dairy out of my diet. I don’t want to give in. I want to get my stuff at the farmers market,  catch the train instead of the car, go on marches, make some fucking noise. If we are going out I want to go out fighting hard. I don’t want to be one of the people  who have the power or information to change and didn’t. But is it too late? Are we too far gone to make a difference? If it’s taken this long, and this much to happen to convince me, how much longer will it take to convince the skeptics? Will it be when all the water evaporates, or we can’t even drink it because it’s so acidic? Will it be when none of us can even eat real food anymore, because there’s not enough grass to feed the livestock or water to grow the crops? Will it be when the cars start catching fire in the streets and people can’t go outside in the daytime because it’s too hot? When people start dying in the street from heatstroke? When will they see?

  
I’m not scared of dying but I don’t want to die like this. I don’t want my friends, my family, the people I love to die like this. I don’t want the people who are already dying from this to die like this.   

I don’t want to live in fear. But I’m so scared. ",0.0,0.27,0.73

4. Opt for renewable energy wherever possible.
5. Go Vegan or Vegetarian or at the very least reduce meat intake.

9. Spread your message
10. Use carbon footprint calculator.

And for the love of God, stop bickering and finding faults with each other. Support anyone and everyone who takes even the tiniest of steps to fight climate change.

I am also referring to Vegans who have problems with climate change warriors and also climate change warriors who hate Vegans. You are both in the same team. Stop hating each other.

We discussed fossil fuels, garbage in nature and everything else. Every spring at the last day of school, the local credit union gave a feast to ten grades of elementary kids for cleaning up the beach.
Ever since climate change became the label, we’ve been stuck between for and against the science.
What about the evidence? The pollution.
If we clean up, we will know. Either way, it’s the only way. In the meanwhile, we can certainly improve in cutting down on pollution.
There is very little coverage about the ocean clean up project for example.
We totally dismiss all these local beach cleaning projects and continue arguing about who is right about the science, instead of just doing the work.
The green future will happen through innovation, it’s how we are as species, always going for the next awesome thing.

I feel that the endless debate about climate change is slowing us down.
It’s giving some people stress and not the relief we get from a clean environment.
It’s giving some people depression and anxiety, because they fear it’s too late and that we will just go on like a flock of lemmings over a cliff.

Seriously considering quitting my good corporate job to work full-time on climate change mitigation, renewable energy, etc. Am I crazy? Looking for advice...","TLDR: reading new UN report has me seriously considering quitting my comfortable corporate job in NYC and moving home to California to pursue working to mitigate climate change full-time in business context.  Am I crazy?  Looking for advice!
---

I (26M) grew up in California and have been on the East Coast (DC and now NYC) for about 10 years.  I've been plodding along in my career in B2B tech and currently have a well paying corporate job in NYC.  I majored in a liberal arts-y meets international relations degree with a focus on environment/energy type stuff but ultimately ended up pursuing a more startup/tech scene career.

I've always been very aware of climate change, etc. and the challenges it poses as well as thinking sometimes about how I'd like to refocus my career on this at some point when it makes sense.  However, after reading parts of the UN Climate Report and related coverage (https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/07/climate/ipcc-climate-report-2040.html), I'm seriously considering quitting my job and moving back to the SF Bay Area in California (to be closer to family and also b/c it seems there is a lot happening there in terms of what I'm interested in) to pursue a career doing SOMETHING to help steer the Earth towards a less sucky future.  I know the cost of living there is quite high.

I'm convinced that we cannot wait for fickle politicians to address this - it must be business solutions to climate change while the general gradually public shifts its tastes/focus by taking these threats seriously (ex: renewable energy becoming more competitive w fossil fuels, meatless 'meat' alternatives, some new refrigerant technology, etc.).  Of course voting in politicians who give a crap about climate change is also important and I intend to do this as well and do whatever I can in terms of public/private partnership type stuff.

I've read the Drawdown book that is frequently cited in this sub.  I have a good amount of money saved up to do a job search for at least a year if necessary but will likely be living with family initially so costs will be low.

Is this crazy?  I feel an urgency to DO SOMETHING that I haven't felt before and feel that I can no longer in good conscience continue in my current career/job (data consulting stuff for fortune 500 companies).

Any guidance is appreciated: ideas about jobs, organizations in SF Bay Area or in wider world, ways to get involved that pay decently, career arcs, feeling like you are truly an agent in this wider effort, etc.  What I want to find is an organization that really does something - not just lip service, not just talk.  Results.  Products.  World-changing feats.  Not BS corporate ""we are going green"" marketing that is meaningless.  I'm aiming high.  I don't want to just feel like I'm ""making a difference"".  I want to know that I truly am, even if it's on a small scale as an individual can only do so much.  Tesla is an obvious, probably cliché example of this (though some would argue there is a lot of talk there!).

I recognize that this is something an optimist would do.  I believe one has to be optimistic in this situation though there is plenty of reason to be pessimistic too given humanity's track record on this issue so far.  Cheers!",0.147,0.12,0.733

86,lozinski,44,0.91,Report From the Climate Change Conference in Katowice,"I live in Katowice. Right next to the “Flying Saucer” where the Climate Change conference starts next week. My girlfriend is one of the volunteers answering questions at the airport. Here is how it looks on the ground.

People are already starting to show up. Reportedly 23,000 people are coming to the conference. Housing is totally tight. The towns nearby are sold out. Many People are commuting 2hrs each way to Krakow. 1.3 -1.4 hrs by bus to Krakow, and then local transport to their house. One woman was reportedly renting and commuting from Ostrava in Czech.

One guy I met was offering to rent his place for 25K Zloty. About $6625 for two weeks. His real estate agent was charging twice that. She did not get a customer, and so he is happy to not have to move.

The venue includes the conference center, the indoor Spodek “Flying Saucer” arena, and a temporary building. It is near my xerox shop. The venue is already cordoned off. To go to my xerox shop I had to cross the road. Reportedly the next two weeks the shop is entirely closed off.

There is a very nice Christmas market in the main square in the center of town.

Today I met two people from Africa. They were renting an apartment in my building, they were going to pay cash, but the owner did not show up. A very nice Polish young man was helping them. He gave them hot spot access. Advice. Walked them over to the taxi. I also stopped to help, but they were in good shape.

The delegates will all receive an equally warm supportive welcome when they get here. God Bless all who are coming, and we all hope that you can achieve some changes. It does appear that the EU at least is aware of the problems, We had huge droughts last summer.

The rivers in Czech were so low, that a stone was uncovered, it had writing on it from centuries ago in old German referring to droughts and famines. “When you see me weep” it said.

When we see the conference resolution, I hope that we will not weep again.",0.0,0.0,1.0

101,tpjv86b,44,0.89,Declines in wakame and kombu seaweed harvests in Japan this season due to higher ocean temperatures and recent typhoons,"Below is my English transcription of the Youtube video and news article:

Seaweeds such as wakame and kombu, common on our dinner tables, are suffering poor harvests these days. In an average year, it would be wakame season right now. When we interviewed in the production region, the situation was serious.

Atami in Shizuoka Prefecture is known as a hot spring resort town. It is said that wakame from here is soft and tastes good. Announcer Maya Kino also helped a little for this year's first natural wakame harvesting trip. The wakame was unusually small this year. In fact, harvesting restrictions were lifted at the end of last month, but because of their small size, the start of the harvesting season was delayed until the 9th. In even more serious shape was the farmed wakame that was harvested during the winter - just one fifth of a normal year's harvest. The impact of all this in Atami is serious. In Atami, the ""Wakame Festival"" is held every year, where you can have all-you-can-eat fresh wakame, wakame miso soup and wakame salad. Since wakame has been growing slowly this year, the festival has been delayed by one month. One restaurant that had been serving wakame shabu-shabu in their regular menu decided to serve it in their secret menu instead. Bad seaweed harvests have been occurring not only in Atami but all over Japan as well.

Wakame in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures is well known as ""Sanriku wakame"", but its production level at the end of last month is 30% lower than during the same period last year. The wholesale price is now higher than even during the immediate aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, when it was scarce. Kombu, which is indispensable to tsukudani and dashi, continues to be in a tough spot. About 90% of Japanese kombu are from Hokkaido, and although the prices set by producers' groups depend on various factors, they have been generally rising for the last three years. Furthermore, in Okinawa, early harvest mozuku have not been growing well, and the wholesale value is higher than last year. When we asked multiple producers' groups about what is causing the bad harvests, they pointed out that seaweed cannot move around like fish. In recent years, sea temperatures have risen, and typhoons hit many areas last year. Since the seaweed itself cannot move to avoid typhoons, they can easily get washed away. In other words, the harshening environment afflicting Japan's oceans is said to be the cause of the poor seaweed harvests.

Half of all cumulative human emissions have occurred during the last ~ 30 years. GHG levels are similar to the cooktop setting on your kitchen range. They determine how hot the pot of water on the stove will ultimately get. The time it takes to reach that equilibrium temperature depends on the volume of water and the composition of the container. 

The ocean is effectively a giant pot of water that takes something like 3-4 decades to incorporate 60% of the heat associated with the new temperature setting. 

If scientists predictions about climate change are accurate, then we would have noticed some changes in the last 30 years. Let's review. 

1) The atmosphere would be warmer

The 20 warmest years on record are the last 20 since 1998.

2) The oceans would be warmer

Oceans are warmer than ever

3) Oceans would be more acidic due to CO2 absorption

Oceans are 30% more acidic. oH has declined from 8.2 to 8.1

4) Ice sheets would be be melting / calving faster

They are

5) Melting ice from Greenland would slow the AMOC

The AMOC has slowed 15% in 50 years

6) Storm intensity would increase

15 storms with sustained winds over 150mph in last 3 years. This is unprecedented. Highest wind speed storm all-time in 2015. 

7) Extreme rain events would increase as a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor (Clausius Clapeyron)

These are happening too

8) The Jet stream should be weakening as the temperature differential between the Arctic and mid-latitudes lessens

The jet stream is getting weaker and more prone to getting stuck in place for longer periods of time.

First, there’s a woman who was on a friends post commenting completely conspiracy-theory based ideas about CO2 and was completely wrong about the chemistry involved at that. I tried to correct it but she just told me all of my science is wrong because Newton’s laws of physics are “outdated.” What? I regularly explain the science and people can’t refute it so they just say “but it’s fake” or “the science isn’t accepted.” Even my own father thinks that climate change is fabricated and scientists are making it up so they have something to study, like we don’t have better things to do.

Recently I have stumbled upon two fascinating articles - “The Hidden Life of Trees” by Peter Wohlleben and “Reciprocity” by Janine Benyus. They discuss how forests are interconnected and individual trees and plants help each other survive. This is completely different from what we are used to hearing about how trees compete with each other for resources.

Peter Wohlleben realizes that there are advantages for trees to working together. “A tree is not a forest. On its own, a tree cannot establish a consistent local climate. It is at the mercy of wind and weather. But together, many trees create an ecosystem that moderates extremes of heat and cold, stores a great deal of water, and generates a great deal of humidity.” It shows how the cooperation between trees has more advantages than competition. When one single tree is sick, others will support it. Wohlleben compares it to a herd of elephants, “Like the her, they, too, look after their own, and they help their sick and weak back up onto their feet. They are even reluctant to abandon their dead.” The dead refers to the tree stump that was kept alive for at least four or five hundred years. And as is known, trees help sequester carbon into the soil and keep it in there for centuries. “Every tree, therefore, is valuable to the community and worth keeping around for as long as possible.” Even more, trees aren’t just connected to each other. They are also cooperating with other plants. For example, while Janine Benyus was working in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, she noticed that grass under the blue oaks was thriving. It is as if oaks were nurturing it and helping it grow.

However, this idea of mutualism in the forest was not always popular. In 1900s, Frederic Clements proposed this idea. Even though he was very famous at that time, his ideas were replaced by Henry Gleason who argued for the competition perspective. Being compared to Clements became one of the biggest admonitions and “a sure sign of naivete.” But his perspective started coming around lately again because of the facts that scientists could not ignore anymore - trees and plants do cooperate.

It has been found that roots of the trees connect to each other and share resources. Simard defined “Wood Wide Web” as “an underground Internet through which water, carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and defense compounds are exchanged.” It can be argued that it happens because trees’ roots grow in different directions and connect by accident. However, Massimo Maffei from the University of Turin showed that plants are good at determining whether roots are theirs or not - including other and their own species. Thus, trees connect with each other on purpose. 

But what does it mean for climate change? 

Climate change is caused by greenhouse gases and there are two primary ways to reduce greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere: either to reduce emissions or to sequester carbon. Most climate change solutions focus on reducing emissions. However, carbon sequestration can be a great option, too. Mutualism is important for storing carbon in the soil as it requires cooperation between microbial networks and plants. As was already noted, cooperation also makes sure more trees survive which contributes greatly to the amount of carbon sequestered. 

Besides the ability of trees to store carbon, it has many implications for other areas. For example, agriculture. As Janine Benyus points out, “Plowing and herbicides such as glyphosate disturb the network and phosphorus fertilizers tell bacterial and fungal helpers that they are not needed - not needed for water transport or pest defense, not needed to absorb the micronutrients our bodies long for.” It means that we artificially disconnect plants in agriculture from one another and they not only lose their ability to store carbon but also to provide us with nutrients we require. If only we realize how significant these networks are and of what great help they can be to reverse the climate change, we would think twice before interrupting the “vital conversation.” 

But most of all, “Wood Wide Web” can be an ingenious psychological metaphor. We tend not only to view plants as consumers and competitors but primarily ourselves. We are used to believing that the world is a scarce place and we need for fight for our place under the sun. But the reciprocity among trees tells us a different story. Mutualism is a big part of nature which helps us to survive. Janine Benyus notices that, “By recognizing, at last, the ubiquity of sharing and chaperoning, by acknowledging the fact that communal traits are quite natural, we get to see ourselves anew. We can return to our role as nurturers, one of the many helpers in this planetary story of collaborative healing.” When will we finally realize that we, humans, are not the destructors by nature? We can be many things and nurturers is one of them.",0.286,0.0,0.714

In an age where continual growth is the aim, where 'smashing our goals', and competing against everyone is all that matters, we've lost a sense of perspective. Life has become ubfeasible.

The truth is, you alone cannot solve the world's problems. Most of us can't even solve the problems of people closest to us, let alone the lives of strangers thousands of miles away. So, let's focus on what we can control. This is where stoic philosophy comes into play.

The stoics believed that there are only two things you can control; everything else is secondary. They are:

1. Your thoughts
2. Your actions

You cannot control how hot the world is going to get. You cannot control the decline of biodiversity. You cannot stop fossil fuels burning. 

What you CAN control, is your behaviour which can ultimately affect the world in a positive way.

Your job, every single day, is to simply focus on being the best citizen you can be. Being environmentally aware. Being positive. Whether you influence those around you or not, is out of your control. So don't worry about it. 

Remember this, and you will feel better about yourself, will worry less about how others will perceive you, and without realising, your actions will have impact.",0.0,0.254,0.746

Can someone explain what is meant by climate change (formally known as global warming)? Specifically, what does climate change mean to the world, other than the climate literally changing? Is it bad for everyone or just some parts of Earth? And, how is it bad?  Is it apocalypse bad? Or is it bad as in polar bears will be extinct?

https://i.redd.it/ix8i88qvr2421.jpg

Hey everyone, I’m doing a project where I write about an eco-friendly form of burial and get feedback on the writing (any kind of feedback really helps).  Also there’s a TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

THE GIST OF IT

Some companies offer biodegradable urns to people as a product that can incorporate the cremated ashes of a person with growing a tree.  In this way, it differs from a traditional burial, but the body’s remains still return to the soil in the end.  While, tree seedlings can’t really grow in ashes, there are different ways biodegradable urns find a way around this.  For example, the Bios Urn has different levels for the soil, seeds, and ashes.  According to Elizabeth Stinson from Wired who wrote about this, “When the root system grows strong enough—generally after a week—water will dissolve the top of the second chamber, allowing the roots and minerals to mix with human ash.”  The company also produced the Bios Incube, which makes it easy for people to know when to water the tree and monitor it.

&#x200B;

CAN HELP AIR QUALITY IN CITIES/NEIGHBORHOODS

If more people started using biodegradable urns, more trees could reduce the impact of greenhouse gasses emitted in the city.  In places where lots of drivers commute, planting new trees helps lessen the impact of car emissions contributing to climate change.  In some cities where officials are concerned with the rising rate of asthma, creating new trees could help.  Plus, having a loved one’s ashes (or maybe yours someday) be turned into a tree near your house/apartment may increase the surrounding air quality.  With products like the Bios Incube, it can be put inside the home and liven up the room too.

&#x200B;

BIODEGRADABLE URNS VS TRADITIONAL BURIAL

You can help others know about biodegradable urns and how green they are, but of course, it is always important to be respectful of others’ wishes and the traditions of some families.  Some families are firm on a traditional burial or only placing the ashes in a temple, but many still have yet to decide what to do.  If people did decide to place their ashes with a biodegradable urn, the worry of how much carbon dioxide cremation releases would be overshadowed by the amount of greenhouse gasses trees absorb through their lifetime, which according to the UCSB ScienceLine can be 100s or even 1000s of years.  While traditional burials take up a lot of unusable land, becoming a tree after you die can go into creating forests, parks, and e.t.c. Julian Uzielli and Lara O'Brien from the CBC report in an article that, “Countries such as China have already started to relocate existing graves and ban future ones, which has been deeply upsetting for those who've already laid loved ones to rest.”  The scarcity of land for graves left also often makes biodegradable urns a cheaper option.

&#x200B;

OTHER BENEFITS

The biodegradable urns can be set almost anywhere and therefore be placed in closer proximity, even in the house if you wanted to.  They can also be planted along walk areas, and improve scenery.  Taking care of the tree could also be a way to deal with the loss of a loved one. It also sets a good impression on future generations to think about the issue of climate change. If someone grows a fruit tree, that tree has the potential to yield fruits for them too.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: After death, you can help suck out carbon dioxide from the air in the form of a tree by placing your ashes in a special urn that companies have designed to mix ashes with soil and completely biodegrade while the tree grows.

\-Some questions to help you comment if you want

Would you consider being made into a tree after you die?

What did you like about the post?

Anything I could have done differently?

Do you think more people will start doing this in the future?

I've tried telling him about the rise in global temperature the last century (and he says ""random professor #14 has evidence to the contrary""), about how how parts of greenland are now getting uncovered and the arctic circle shrinking (""temperature just goes in cycles naturally, the arctic circle is bigger than ever says random professor #11, NASA satellites are contolled by the globalists, carbon dioxide is required for life, Sweden was tropic back when dinosaurs roamed the Earth.

219,_suited_up,28,0.84,What happened? I really didn't think climate change denial was as prevalent as it seems to be.,"Recently watched a video in which Bill Nye speaks a bit about climate change and was completely blown away by the comments section...


Comment after comment people were directly attacking Bill Nye as a person and using his belief that climate change is 100% caused by human activity as a means to belittle him as a scientist. 

Say what you want about BIll Nye, he may not be the very best spokesperson for global warming but the sheer amount of comments spouting ""facts"" that climate change is not only a hoax, but a device with which scientists gain from personally and financially absolutely blew me away. 

Maybe i'm a bit insulated since I'm in college and have dreamed of a life in academia but I really didn't think denial was that prevalent. To some who watch Fox News religiously, sure, but I'm still having trouble really coming to terms with the fact that there are people out there (and a significant amount of people too) that *genuinely* think the current rate of global warming isn't 100% caused by human activity. 


To make the argument that the Earth goes through natural cycles of heating and cooling and stand by that as a reason for distrusting the scientific community is astonishing to me. Millions of years compared to a few decades? Fuck it, a thousand years even compared to just the last 5 and somehow this argument of ""natural periods of heating and cooling"" has become the rallying cry of everyone who thinks global warming is some grand scheme that scientists have devised to make bank. 


I look very very much forward to making my own contributions to the scientific community one day, however big or small.

I've been sailing along blithely thinking I've been doing a good job by recycling, buying used fuel efficient vehicles and maintaining them well, growing some of my own vegetables, and reducing my meat intake. 

But it's warmer outside today than I think I remember it being. I should need a heavy jacket, but long sleeves and a light jacket are just fine. I just shoo'd a mosquito out of my car. We were supposed to have enough frosts by now that they all should be dead. Then I think back to flying over the country (I work in aviation) and note that lawns are staying greener longer. Trees haven't lost all their leaves yet. The red tide I saw blooming in lakes and on the ocean. The election that has brought with it the threat of climate change deniers and rollback of environmental policy. 

So I started doing some research. Looking at ocean temperatures. Atmospheric temperatures. Esoteric discussions of timelines and issues facing locations around the globe. 

Holy shit. This is gonna be bad. 

The wind got completely taken out of me. 

30-40 years to effect change and put it in overdrive?

100 years and mass migration, war and starvation are in progress?

150-200 years and civilization as we know it will decline to nonexistence?


Am I wrong or is this really what I'm reading?  Is this the timeline humanity is looking at? I wouldn't have had kids had I known this. My grandchildren likely won't survive to old age.  This is horrible. I spent the day writing to the president, president elect, and all my reps. It's put me in a doomsday prepper train of thought. I can't believe people aren't screaming for change. Help me to understand how this unfolds.

It just occurred to me that maybe there is a bacteria, fungus, insect or a plant that could capture carbon faster than any tree or a machine.

Secondly, if one doesn't seem to exist, could we genetically engineer such a life form?

I'm aware capturing carbon from air is very difficult. 400ppm is just that... 400 parts per 1,000,000 in total. Like finding 400 people in a crowd of million.

So let's say we discover or create such a bacteria. Perhaps some of the world's great lakes could be converted to house the said bacteria and have it push out oxygen (and capture carbon) much faster, as a test. A genetically modified phytoplankton perhaps.

I guess in the longterm that lake would then become particularly acidic over time, but it might be a necessary sacrifice. But maybe there's another biological or a chemical solution for that.

At any rate, the life form would have to absorb carbon (or carbon dioxide), live its life, and then die, leaving behind carbon residue in a form that doesn't get released back into the environment. If or when the said bacteria is released into the oceans, the stored carbon minerals would perhaps sink to the bottom.

I guess for any such (micro) organism we would have to have a kill switch in place, a countermeasure ready, such as an enemy predator organism. Whatever the case, we would ALWAYS have to be 2 or more steps ahead of nature, or rather, ourselves. Metaphorically, if you intend on playing with fire, you better have a bucket of water nearby. And a phone. And a fire extinguisher. And a mop. Insurance. Another place to stay. And so on, and so on.

My wife basically told me to stop whining and do something about it. LOL. She's right, of course. But what can I really do?

We can try to conserve energy and waste less food and water. However, the very fact that we live in a house in the suburbs makes us automatically use more resources than others. 

I thought, well maybe I'll sell the house and live in a smaller apartment. But then someone else would be living in the house and using as much, if not more, resources. 

I bought an electric car last year. I needed a new car. My old car had 160,000 miles on it and was strating to cost a fortune in maintenance. So I bought the electric car. I guess it's better than buying an ICE car, but the mere act of buying a new car increased my carbon footprint.

I want to do something. However, I don't want to be the only one making great personal sacrifices. Most won't make the changes necessary on their own. Therefore, one person choosing to live sustainably really won't make much of a difference.

If the whole world is going up in flames anyway, I might as well enjoy the time I have.

The problem is so big that only massive government intervention can solve it. However, that doesn't seem remotely likely in at least the near future.

So far, our protests and marches have created some awareness but have not resulted in much impact. We can't rely on our leaders to change something because they just won't.

Aside from being a fervent supporter in the climate change fight, I am a corporate finance adviser by profession and I know things that could be described as ""behind the scenes"", that layman would not normally see. Did you know that your banks, insurance companies, pension companies all invest your hard-earned coins in funds that in turn invest heavily in oil companies. Why? Because they are profit maximizing companies and these investment give them maximum profit. So, why would renewable energy bother to them? Oil is a decreasing supply commodity. Falling supply means higher price. So, you got it.

I pondered over the problem from a financial perspective and I found a system where we can make a much bigger impact than just desperately marching and trying to convince our governments to act. Investment shape the world we live in. If we all join hands and invest together in what we believe in, we will yield much higher results. We will have a higher power to convince. We need to upgrade from being scattered tribes to becoming an empire. Then we will stand a chance to create change. And above all, we will receive a much higher return than all of us investing in our own solar plants.

Essentially, from what I'm seeing

* 1 If everyone meets the Paris agreement, we're still going over 2C
* 2 To prevent going over 2C, we need to not only drastically cut CO2 emissions, but also do massive CCS?

I started freaking out about climate change in 2014 when I realized that that, coupled with global topsoil depletion, resource depletion, and nuclear threats, will probably mean most of humanity, us included will likely suffer horribly and die painfully as we watch everything w elove go to hell, ourselves, the past, and future, as well, in the next 2 decades or so.

I went to a psych ward in 2014 because of a psychotic episode brought on because of anxiety over climate change. I was crying all day because of the fear of imminent death by starvation, murder, thirst, etc. caused by climate change.

Now I'm thinking about checking myself in the hospital again. After reading g na article saying well reach the world shattering 2C climate change point by 2030, I've realized I have so little time left and all my dreams are crushed I should probably kill myself once that rolls around (around 2030, when the US, where I live, will be reduced to Somalia like conditions and people are starving everhwhers) ...

Still, just knowing everything, past, present, and future, is going to hell and I'll probably be murdered and cannibalize while my loved ones are too... I just want to die sometimes and I'm thinking of dropping school and my internships (I've been in a glorified community college for 8 years because I'm a superloser)

I'm just so heartbroken. I had so many dreams. I just want all the fear to end.

Please help. I'm so scared and I don't wanna get addicted to xanax which I've been stealing to not feel so scared

Maybe I just have to teach myself to accept that I'll probably die horrible in the next 10 years or live in extreme poverty until I have to resolve to off myself.

This isn't what I wanted for my life. I had so many desires and hopes and dreams and they're all gone because civilization is ending. How to cope with going crazy?",0.067,0.395,0.538

He's 70, I'm 27, so I'm naturally on the opposite side and I believe we need to be concerned with the amount of CO2 we're putting out. I'm not great at debating so I mostly only have feelings and not facts. I know a lot of scientists recently got together and warned the government about climate change, I know a massive majority of scientists are concerned about climate change, etc, but I don't know lots of good specifics. My dad listens to radio stations like Hannity and watches Fox, if I had to guess, probably around two hours every day if not more. He is REALLY certain that he is in the right, and when trying to convince me that he's right he will go on to explain how information is being twisted and it's all being done so the government can tax people etc.

It would be nice if I could change his mind, but I don't expect that to be a realistic goal. He's old, he's going to believe in what he believes in, and I'm okay with that. I mostly just want a better understanding for myself since he's actively trying to gaslight me (I'm in close quarters doing work with him most days lately).

Out of curiosity, I asked him if I could see his sources. He gladly said he would email them to me. I thought I would get some obscure alternative science sources, but I got one singular source from [Fox Fucking News, linked here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fA5sGtj7QKQ) The guy's name is Dr. Patrick Michaels, not sure if that name sounds familiar to anyone.

I don't know if this is relevant since it's about 5 years old now but I recently reviewed [Veritasium's video on this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIUhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWXoRSIxyIU) and I agree with most of the points he's laid out. I'm taking lots of this with grains of salt: 

I'm not taking either video as an absolute truth of course, just wanted to see where he was coming from. I really don't trust Fox, and to a large extent I don't trust most mainstream news either. I don't even trust myself and I'm not sure I can trust reddit at this point. Obviously if I'm posting on the climatechange subreddit it's going to favor younger people who believe climate change is a real danger, so I don't know sometimes if the information I'm getting is biased or if there is real truth to what I'm reading. I worry that I'm so scared of things being Fake News that I just end up rejecting everything I'm given sometimes.

314,climate_fiction_guy,22,0.82,Which climate scientists have most influenced you?,"I'll share a list of mine and some highlights of how they have shaped my understanding.

1. John Tyndall

Over 150 years ago, he demonstrated the greenhouse effect of GHG's like CO2. 


2. James Hansen

Generally, his passion for the topic has caused me to dig deeper.


3. Dr. Jennifer Francis - Rutgers

Her explanation of how climate change is effecting weather patterns, specifically via altering the Jet Stream and Circumpolar wind currents resulting in stuck weather patterns (more extreme rainfall and heat waves)

4. Karen Pistone

Led a 2014 study quantifying the impact of lost albedo in the Arctic which concluded that lost albedo was causing warming equivalent to 50% of all cumulative anthropogenic emissions.

5. Dr. Eric Rignot - NASA and UCI

His specialty is the satellite and radar measurement of the cryosphere. A few years back he claimed that big portions of W. Antarctica were melting irreversibly. Digging into this claim and understanding the ocean / ice interface and the topography under the ice sheets tipped me into a heightened concern about climate change 2 years ago.

Some of his work incorporates the work of Jennifer Francis and the understanding of how changing ocean currents are bringing warm water to the ice sheets.

6. DeConto and Pollard

Developed the theory of Marine Ice Sheet Instability which is a potential missing link in understanding how ice sheets can rapidly disintegrate as they have in recent geologic past. ~ 15k years ago, sea levels rose ~ 1 foot per decade for ~ 500 years. 

That ice is now long gone and we won't see an exact repeat of that. But they have put together a lot of elements which help modelers reconcile their warming models to past sea level rise. 

The proof will be in the data in the coming decade or two. Just a theory for now.

7. Dr. Kerry Emanuel MIT

His specialty is in extreme weather and hurricane prediction. His work points to more intense and wet storms resulting from climate change, albeit with less storm formation intensity. 

8. Jeff Donnelly, Woods Hole

Has made strides in paleo-evidence of hurricane activity. Using ocean holes where sediments collect, he's able to reconstruct storm activity for several millennia. Combining that with oxygen isotope ratios which enable a reconstruction of ocean temperatures, a solid relationship between storm intensity and ocean temperature.

9. Charles Keeling and historical CO2 mappers. 

CO2 isn't the only GHG, but it's a good proxy. Understanding the GHG's are at a 5M year high and likely to hit a 20M year high in my lifetime is pretty significant. 

That's my core list. I'm interested to add to that list based upon the feedback of others.

I imagine that this could be hooked up to wind turbines and other renewables to create carbon capture stations. I wonder how large something like this could be scaled up. Carbon separation from CO2 is much more effective under exposure to UV light so I'd be curious to know if the chamber which contains the  electrical arc could be exposed to sunlight somehow (bubble of transparent material that doesn't impede UV, possibly glass?) if carbon sequestration yield could be increased? (https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2003/03/030320073502.htm)

The thing about electricity is that even after arcing, it still exists and needs to ground. In theory this system could simply be a relay on a path to utilization of the same electricity for consumer purposes.

329,krazykoo,19,0.84,What I'm doing to reduce my carbon footprint.,"Hello all!

It's difficult to stay positive sometimes and wonder what us individuals can do to fight climate change, so I wanted to outline what I'm personally doing to reduce my carbon footprint. I've altered aspects of my life in the past year, and while on a large scale it isn't much, it makes me proud of what it is that I can control.

&#x200B;

**ELECTRICITY**

* Starting April 1st, I will get 100% of my home electricity from renewable resources. I pay extra for this through my energy provider in California, and don't mind how it will marginally increase the cost of my bill compared to the 40% renewables on the grid (in SF). I'm from BC, Canada which is 97% renewable, and wanted to get back to that.
* Using smart home tech I have significantly reduced my energy usage through automation. Lights, fans, and other devices now auto-power off if I'm not in the room or leave my apartment. My energy bill is now just \~$25 per month down from around $38 (34.2% decrease).

&#x200B;

**SOLAR**

* Prior to having the option to acquire 100% renewables for my energy bill, I experimented with solar panels.
* I capture and store, through a 21W solar panel in my apartment window, enough energy to power my phone, headphones, and other wireless devices each day. The setup was simple, and it's a nice thought each day that your phone is effectively solar-powered.

&#x200B;

**GAS**

* After moving to SF I realized the heating in my place is primarily gas. Coming from Canada, I decided I would not need heating (or could warm up in other ways) and had my gas shut-off about 8 months ago. This saves about $15/mo alone on the pilot light, and reduces the constant burn of natural gas.
* For the past 6 years I have rarely used my car, only driving about 1-3 times per month. A year ago I put my car in storage and save about $200/mo on insurance. I walk to work, grocery store, or wherever I want and don't drive. If needed, I take an Uber maybe 1-2 times per month on a short trip and otherwise use local transit (electric).

&#x200B;

**FOOD**

* I've rarely eaten red meat for the last 10 years anyway (due to preference), so I primarily consume chicken or soy-based proteins.
* I'm not overweight, and am very good at estimating my calorie consumption to avoid any food waste.
* A portion of my nutrients (typically breakfast) comes from Soylent (powder) and is more sustainable with less waste.
* I purposefully avoid eating at restaurants or establishments that have higher food portions (which I cannot finish) regardless if I like the food. Otherwise, see if I can split it into two meals.

&#x200B;

**PLASTIC**

* As a consumer, given the choice I will purchase a product in more sustainable packaging even if it's a higher cost. I look for paper, glass, or recycled components in the packaging when possible. This doesn't take much time at all.
* Every piece of plastic I do consume I properly recycle, and when necessary ensure it's been cleaned without residue so it can be recycled.
* Plastic bags are avoided. I will carry items, use reuseable or paper-based bags instead. This is fairly easy as they are banned in SF in many cases.
* I avoid plastic lids + straws with drinks. Most of the time I only order water anyways, but will opt-out of these.
* If getting an item to-go, I will hand back any plastic utensils or other items not needed.

&#x200B;

**AS A CONSUMER**

* I try to live a more minimalistic lifestyle, and aren't a big fan of 'trinkets' or useless items. I only buy what I need, and what I know I will use. I'm not an impulse-buyer, and don't end up with a lot of junk to begin with. 
* I resell or donate any items I can that I do not need. I will avoid throwing anything out if someone else can use it.
* In my job I promote less waste and make decisions that support this. In Marketing, traditionally there can be a lot of waste whether paper or useless promotional items, and I steer the team and company away from this.

I feel like I'm doing a lot already, but also that I'm just getting started. I'm working on possibly carbon-offsetting any remaining emissions I produce, and also investing in primarily green companies that are fighting against climate change.

1. Speak with  consideration & respect, online the same as in person.  Don't 'play  to the crowd' for the cheers of the people who feel the same way you do;  by doing that you're just adding another echo to the chamber.
2. When someone says or posts something you disagree with, listen and ask questions.  Understand their perspective.  It's hard to change someone's mind if you don't understand why they think what they do.  If you end up still disagreeing, accept the difference; hopefully they'll remember the respect you  showed.
3. If you're dealing with a jerk, consider the context.   If it's someone you know, it's okay to express your disappointment and let them know you expect better from them.  If it's an anonymous troll, remember that by trolling you they're trying to add echos  to their own chamber; the best thing you can do is muffle it.

Deniers say climate change/fluctuations is normal, natural, and has occurred. The rebuttal against this is that natural/historic environmental change has never occurred at the rate it currently is. However, how can we say this given that historic/paleontological records are low resolution averages?  
As an analogy, assume we have daily stock data for the past month, and monthly stock data for the past decade, and that we observe a rapid drop over the past month. Given this data, how can we say a similar rapid drop didn't occur in the past decade?  How can we make conclusions about the intra-monthly stock variability beyond just the past month?  
In the context of climate change, if temperatures increased rapidly over 50 years then decreased the following 50 years, would this not be missed by low resolution records (say every 100 yrs). How do we know this type of change didn't occur? How can we say change as rapid as we are seeing didn't occur before humans without equally rapid measurements?

It began in may with temperatures above 25°C. A normal summer would be between 20-25°C over here. Rarely we have about 30°C and 40°C is a total exception for a few days. Since about may the temperatures were constantly above those 25°C. That lasted for about a whole month before we had about 1 1/2 weeks of cooler weather and a little bit of rain. But since about the beginning of june it is back and we now have temperatures above 28°C every single day until the present day. The last two weeks have been at least at 30-32°C on a daily basis. Last week we reached the first peak of 37°C while the other days were around 32°C-35°C on average. Upday just infomed me that this week we will get 38°C and it might be past the 40°C mark at some point and there is no end in sight.

The consequences are devastating. As our flora is used to a very different climate of 17°C to 25°C on average everything that once was green turned brown like hay cause it has been burnt out by the sun. Agricultural fields are burning on a daily basis. People can't function properly anymore and I have to think very hard if we had more than 3 rain days in total or when was the last time I slept more than 6 hours and not waking up on 8am due to the heat that is present already. I am self employed so I normally get up at 10am and get to bed at around 2am if you are confused. 

Yesterday I turned the radio on and it was the big news of the month that we had some rain all over Germany for about 2 minutes in total. Also because of the heat we didn't have rich harvests at all and are in a lack of potatoes (no stereotypical jokes please) and therefore fries are now officially shorter and will be more expensive. Some villages alredy start to ration their water because their water pump facilities start to have problems delivering enough water to the citizens. 

This really reminds me of Interstellar as we already took the first step into that direction I suppose. 

I am also kind of worried about how it ends. You certainly know what happens in Africa when there has been a huge draught and then it rains so heavily that the whole land will be flooded. And in the past we already had some serious floods after only two weeks of a draught. Also If I remember correctly the claimate change functions both ways. Hot summers and bitter cold winters right? Also if it is the same all over the world at the moment then this years hurricane season might be even more devastating than last year with Irma and the two following storms.",0.0,0.0,1.0

[https://www.facebook.com/conservativestoday/photos/a.1054053151281932/2319547974732437/?type=3&theater](https://www.facebook.com/conservativestoday/photos/a.1054053151281932/2319547974732437/?type=3&theater)

I thought I'd put a post here for anyone else that runs into it.

The numbers in the meme all come from a single [2010 paper by Kelliher and Clark](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/j.agrformet.2009.11.019?fbclid=IwAR2_4hFedXzw4uetyFO12EQDHdpC0HFzattxD7YmDOSTuDj3Z76-dL_QzK8). The meme, however, grossly misrepresents the paper.

First, the meme starts by claiming that there were ""60 million buffalo"" in the US. However, this number appears specifically so the authors can dismiss it because ""The population estimate was proposed without explanation"", and then go on to state that ""bison herd population estimates from the popular literature as greatly overstated"". Then then explain why they choose 30M, half the figure stated in the meme.

Then the meme claims there are ""9.4 million dairy and 31.7 million beef cows in America"". That number also  appears in the original paper. However, it is preceded by the important statement that it includes only the cattle ""in the 10 American states occupying the bison’s historic range"". This is not the number of cattle in the US, it's the number of cattle in the great plains. If one simply googles ""number of cattle in the usa"" you'll find the total is actually around 95 million.

They make the rhetorical argument that one has to ""...prove cow fats are more destructive the the environment..."". Of course the paper also demonstrates this as well, calculating that the average modern cow releases 19% more CH4 than historical bison. The meme concludes by dismissing the whole thing, but as the paper notes, ""Thus, the Great Plains bison were estimated to have made a significant contribution to enteric CH4 emissions in the pre-industrial world.""

To put this in a global perspective, there are currently about [170 million buffalo in the world](http://www.mjas.ukim.edu.mk/files/MJAS-01-02-_2011_-048-Borghese.pdf), utterly dominated by domestic water buffalo. In contrast, there are [just over 1.4 billon cows](https://www.drovers.com/article/world-cattle-inventory-ranking-countries-fao). So even in the most ridiculous overestimates of bison populations, they remain a drop in the bucket compared to the cattle numbers.

381,PimplyChuds,18,1.0,Is a focus on carbon emissions an oversimplification?,"To start with, I'll just let you guys know I'm writing from the perspective of the UK, so my experience of climate change discourse is very much based on discussions happening here. 

Now to my question. This morning I was listening to the radio and the news bulletin said government advisors were claiming we need to switch entirely to electric cars by 2030. The bulletin ended, however, by saying that it was uncertain whether or not enough cobalt could be mined to achieve this goal. 

I've been thinking about this a lot recently. Climate change discourse (in the UK at least) seems very much focused on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral, to the extent that technological solutions still seem to be the norm in this discourse. I'm talking electric cars, wind turbines, solar panels, etc. Although I advocate all of these methods of renewable energy, are we just going to be swapping one crisis for another? 

I'll explain further. What I mean is, if the UK was to switch to electric cars by 2030, would the intensive mining of cobalt in other countries (I assume you can't mine cobalt in the UK) mean we'll simply be promoting the emission of carbon elsewhere? So even though the UK will be able to say it's carbon neutral (in terms of transport at least), it will basically have offset that by causing more emissions elsewhere.

By swapping the crisis I also mean we'll be swapping a greenhouse gases crisis for a resource crisis. Surely the mining of all these resources will have a huge impact on the landscape and habitats. Furthermore, resources aren't unlimited. 

So my question, essentially, is: is focusing only on carbon emissions and getting carbon neutral an oversimplification of the issue in an attempt to make it easier to sell and understand? Don't get me wrong, I 100% back reducing carbon emissions and going carbon neutral, but I can't help but feel the consequences of this process haven't been considered fully. It seems that, as with the majority of the climate change debate, the vastness of this crisis isn't fully being comprehended and instead simple and quick fixes are being attempted. 

Totally willing to have my mind changed though! In fact, I'd rather someone did change it because my view is a bit depressing/complicated/it makes my brain hurt.",0.167,0.0,0.833

They considered parallel years, such as 2014 when a near-El Nino was reached before conditions revived a year later, creating one of the three most powerful such events in the past half century.  


""There is more heat now below the surface waiting to be tapped than there was in early 2015,"" said Michael McPhaden, a senior scientist with US National Atmospheric and Oceanic Administration who attended the Chilean event.

411,EarnestQuestioner,17,0.83,What can one person REALLY do?,"But honestly, what can one person really do?  What REAL impact can one single individual make about climate change?

One person making even an extreme change in their lifestyle (such as going from meat-eating to vegan as some suggest) isn't going to make even a minute difference in the big picture. Heck even offing oneself to thus ensure making a no additional carbon footprint in one's future isn't going to make a buy the world a additional millisecond.  Even if the average adult devoted the rest of their lives to fighting climate change (by living the most carbon neutral lifestyle, spending 100% of their spare time planting trees & working with climate change fighting charities) I don't' see where it would make little to no difference.

I truly doubt that a non-average person can make a difference on their own.  Would it even matter if a multi-millionaire spend all of their money buying land & planting trees to offset carbon emissions?  (Seriously, someone do the calculation on this please.)

The only real way to make any effective change is with power & influence.  The bulk of emissions is done by corporations.  So until those stop, climate change will continue.  Industrial emissions would need to be heavily regulated & corporate culture would need to change globally from ""make money first"" to ""go green even if it costs us money & is inconvenient"".  This is highly unlikely to happen, as the world's economy is based on these corporations making money.  Also, even if one major government would regulate its industry, that won't do anything to affect those in other countries (other than to give them an economic advantage).

Technology is the only other answer that I see, but that is dependent in large part on those very industries which need to be regulated.  Also, on having the right person in the right circumstances (i.e., intelligent, educated people funded to do research which probably won't make money) which in large part seems to be luck.

I'm not a climate change expert or economist, or hold any position of power or influence.  I'm just an average person struggling to get by in life (like billions of other people here on this planet), & wishing that I could do something that actually would make a difference.  I'd like to help, but I just don't see anything that I do is going to make any significant difference.  It just seems futile anyway unless those with greater power than me make big changes & I'm not too optimistic about that.

 I apologise if this a redundant inquiry. However, there exists currently, very well put ideas about sea level instability that's supported with well cited evidence and peer review criticism. My question is in regards to rising sea levels over time and the relationship with coastal communities.

The idea of rising sea levels leads to the assumption that coastal inhabitants will be forced to migrate inland. However, do you think that our ability to adapt to extreme environments can effect this, and to what degree if true? One obvious example could include New Orleans being under sea level currently and their very effective use of levies, for the time being (I know Katrina and what not but you get the idea).

Then somebody on the left says *You can't do that...anti-science!*...etc. Then something like this happens...and the left says *See! Climate change!...* Which the news media seem to think is fine...

I suppose I thought we could say things like: climate change makes droughts in certain areas more likely...so it may have contributed to (e.g.) the Camp Fire...but we can't say more than that. We can only know about increased and decreased likelihoods.

I have known about climate change for almost my entire life, but it wasn't until recently when I disvovered how bad it was really going to get. I always thought about how sad it was that there wouldn't be much snow anymore and how many animals would die out, but I could at least accept it thinking that at least humanity would survive. But now, I know about something even more terryfing. A truth that has given me the largesr existential crisis I have ever felt. The truth is:

**We are literally living through the last few generations of the entire human species** 

Hell, I'll probably witness it. Imagine. Seeing with your own bare eyes the slow downward spiral of an entire species. Witnessing all of our accomplishments and cultures ceasing to exist due to our own volition while the universe barely notices. I have never been more deppressed and terrified in my entire life.

For a long time I used to be incredible afraid of death. Not the act of dying, but by the general concept of death itself. Eventually I came to the conclusion that if I couldnt stop death, at least I have an effect on what comes after, on my chidlren and grandchildren. I'm still a bit scared of death but I had made made peace with it based on the idea that what I did now, my works, education and accomplisments if any, could be passed down to future generations. 

Only I now know that there wont be future generations. Or at least not long lasting ones. So now I want to ask the same question again:

What is the point?

I should preface by saying that I am 21 years old and still in education. I really want, or rather wanted, to be very educated, graduate high school and so on. But recently, I have given up. Now I no longer have the energy or willpower to go into class, listen to some boring lecture that I would forget in a week, or even any desire to work in general. I have no longer have as much desire to get fit and gain a girlfriend/boyfriend. Call me a defeatist or pessimist but I honestly no longer see any reason to follow my passion or even continue going on knowing that its all going to go to hell soon.

Now before you start going on about how its not that bad or that we might fix it soon, I'm just gonna straight up say it: We wont fix it. Humans are incredibly short sighted creatures and so a massive percentage of us doesnt believe in it or are too lazy to do anythong about it because its not clear at the moment how alarming it is. This isn't like changing your toothbrush or something, people need MASSIVE lifestyle changes and good luck convincing the hundreds of millions of people who have gotten so used to their way of life to make large amount of changes in their lives due to a overwhelming disaster that isnt straight on their doorsteps. Not like it would do anything though considering we have FAR passed the point of no return so that even if everything would come to a halt, it wont make any massive dent. The worst part is that the denial can even be found and felt here on Reddit. 

In a recent AskReddit post that was about what problems 0-8 year olds would have growing up, you had to scroll down far to find ANY memtion of climate change. You know what was above it? Social media and privacy issues. Who the hell cares about an old embarrassing picture of you going online when you are literrally burning to death in fiery wasreland while suffering through numerous cancers

My fears have gotten so bad to the point that anytime I see a kid, my first thoughts are something along the lines of: ""that kids gonna burn to a crisp in a few decades"".

So in short, I have given up. I have given up on my passions and everything. Its not just me going on doomsday tirades, these are literally coming from the words of educated scientists. But doing anythinf to combat it would be literally screaming into a void. I feel like a protoganist in one of those Lovecraft tales, the ones who go mad after discovering a horryfing truth, like how the world will end soon, while knowing that they can't convince the blissfully ignorant populace.

So in the end, yeah. I'm done.

By way of background, the EPA's conclusion prior to 2017 was that anthropogenic emissions were ""very likely"" the root cause of observations of climate change.

In March 2017, the current EPA administrator refuted the pre-existing EPA position and claimed there was ""tremendous disagreement"" about the impact of human activities on the planet. 

The EPA was asked to produce the evidence they were drawing from to support the revised position and responsive documents were due to be provided yesterday, July 2. 

This sub spends a crapload of time and energy arguing about this so I'm sure there will be a lot of interest.  

UPDATE. Just found this update on 7/2. EPA requested a delay and judge gave extension of next deliverable until this Friday 7/6.

I've been worried about climate change for a few weeks now, ever since I read about how it might destroy the world- or at least modern society- as early as 2040 or so. It has consumed my mind completely.

I've read so many articles- dozens of them- that talk about billions of dollars in structural damage from storms and millions of refugees every year. I've read about mass famine, widespread water pollution, drought that would make California's current drought situation look like Greenpeace's paradise. And that's only what's predicted to happen in the continental US. I'm 23 years old. By the time I'm 83, there won't be clean water for Americans to drink. There won't be food for them to eat. Millions of people will be displaced. Disease will run rampant. We may not even have any form of organized government anymore, let alone such modern conveniences as communication devices and entertainment.


And given the current situation, I have literally been suicidal. I consider shooting myself in the head more than once a day. People on Facebook have offered to call the hospital for me and pack my suitcase. I've been crying for hours at a stretch without pause. My head hurts. I can't eat. I can't sleep. I want to die now, by my own hand, before I die in 20 or 30 years of dehydration or famine or heat stroke or disease or God knows what else. I know it's not healthy but I don't want to get help because I feel like any attempt to make myself feel safer is just lying to myself. Why should I even attempt to enjoy anything in life at all when, as soon as 20 or 30 years from now, it's quite likely I won't have food, water or shelter? Everything in life I've ever taken for granted- food, water, clothing, a semi-coherent government, living to old age- that certainty is gone. Besides, I have classes to take, and I can't just go AWOL for a week while someone doses me up with Prozac.

Why aren't people scared as about this as I am? Why aren't people rioting in the streets about THIS more so than anything else?? Why aren't people scrambling for answers like I am? Do they simply not care or is it just too far away for them to think about? Sometimes I wish that I could go back to living in blissful ignorance, but I can't. I can occasionally force myself to eat or take a bath or watch Netflix, but I can't enjoy any of it. All I can think is, ""Soon I won't have enough water to bathe in. Soon I'll be eating expired canned goods if I'm lucky, rather than a sandwich. Soon I won't have a TV to watch."" and so on...

It's not as though I've done *exactly* nothing though. I've donated $25 to the Sierra Club. I've turned off my ad blocker and downloaded Ecosia, I've signed half a dozen petitions, voted, sworn off beef, called local climatologists, written to Trump and all my congressmen, and I refuse to use any form of heating this fall and winter- although half of that is just because I love the cold and I'm going to miss it when a couple decades from now our seasons are Summer, Hotter Summer, Death By Heatstroke, and More Summer.

Why the hell is no one else afraid? My friend told me the other day that he was worried about AI taking over in the future.

The questions are pretty generic and isn't anything unique when comparing it to other surveys on this topic. If you want to take the time to do it then I thank you and appreciate your help. Also it has questions that say ""Canadian government"". If you aren't from Canada then just think about your country because that's what the question is relating to, I'm just from Canada so sorry about that. Thanks.

Within the last two years or so my viewpoint started to change as I really started to see the way the world is, with these latest climate change predictions I’ve sort of lost hope that the nation as a whole will change enough in time to actually make a difference. 

I guess the reason I’m posting this is because I feel lost, like the joy has been sucked out of my life. The things that mattered so much to me seem so stupid and trivial now, all I use to care about was getting ahead financially.

I'm an expat currently living in Amsterdam, Netherlands. 

Seeing as much of the Netherlands lies below sea level, I would have thought that sea level rise and land loss would be a major concern for the everyday person residing here, however any dutch person I bring it up with pretty much dismisses it out of hand as nothing to worry about.

I own an apartment here and am already thinking about when I would have to sell, obviously it would be best to sell before the market collapses from the threat of rising ocean levels.

This person suggests that because the CO2 output and temperature increase were wrong -- this casts enough doubt to reasonably say that ""we dont know if man is influenceing climate change""  - can someone above my paygrade help educate me?  His post is as follows ----  ""Here, let me get you started:
Hansen, J., I. Fung, A. Lacis, D. Rind, S. Lebedeff, R. Ruedy, G. Russell, and P. Stone, 1988: Global climate changes as forecast by Goddard Institute for Space Studies three-dimensional model. J. Geophys. Res., 93, 9341-9364.
This, in fact, is the study, which hooked me. Hansen's testimony to Congress the following year had me on the bandwagon.
These 8 scientists processed data of CO2, CH4, H2O, chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and stratospheric aerosols from 1958 to the mid-1980's then ran three scenarios for future predictions, based on the trends they uncovered.
Scenario B was (up through 2011) pretty damn near accurate.
It overestimated warming by about 25% against what actually came to happen, but that is still pretty damn good, even though it underestimated the amount of CO2, in the atmosphere from what he projected might occur in Scenario B (which he termed ""business as usual"").
In 1950, we were pumping about 6 gigatonnes into the atmosphere; in 1960 about 9.5 gigatonnes; 1970, about 15 gigatonnes; by 1980 about 19.5 gigatonnes -- at the time Hansen et al. published their study, we were at 21.8 gigatonnes ... that's an avg increase of approx. .416 gigatonnes annum.
By 1990 we were at 22.3 gigatonnes; by 2000, were up to 24.7 gigatonnes and up to 33.5 gigatonnes by 2010, by 2013, we were at 35.84 gigatonnes -- that's an average of .589 million tonnes annum.
In layman's terms, we increased our CO2 dumping by almost 30% in the last 20 years over the previous 30 years, and yet temperature increases proved 25% lower than projected in the study.
No subsequent study has dislodged this very basic math -- let me reword that. No subsequent study by **NASA*** has dislodged this basic math.
Model 102 IPCC CMIP-5, for example, predicted temperature increases, based on the tonnage listed above, on average should be .4 degrees C warmer than they are.
This *suggests* the Earth's Climate is nowhere near as sensitive to CO2 saturation as we once once thought, which takes me full circle back to my very first point ... anthropogenic climate change is NOT settled science.""",0.309,0.115,0.576

But recently I heard someone talking about how using wood in construction is a form of carbon capture, as trees are not burned for energy (and carbon thus released back into the atmosphere), but rather stored for long-term in the form of houses, thus ""locking in"" the carbon. It made sense to me, and I started thinking about how this same logic could be applied to books, where trees are processed into paper which is then stored for the long-term. 

I'm not a scientist and couldn't find much about the carbon capture qualities of paper books on Google, so thought I'd ask the informed people on this sub. Does this line of thinking make sense or am I way off? Are paper books actually good for climate change? I guess in the grand scheme of things the amount of carbon actually captured from books is negligible, but I'm curious about whether the choice to convert to ebooks for the environment is actually counter productive or not.

635,Semitar1,10,0.78,How to effectively discuss climate change with deniers and skeptics [What are their clearest outlined criticisms?],"I want to understand the camp that either criticizes the existence or extent of climate change. It's hard to do so because some of the popular claims I have heard aren't very specific. If there are more substantive claims, please let me know.

Claim 1: Climate change doesn't exist

My criticism with this claim is that it doesn't offer any context, so the only assumption that I can make is that they are making a very ignorant, unscientific claim that they don't believe the climate doesn't change *at all*. Even if they were saying that the planet suffered no deleterious impacts, that would be inconsistent with documented evidence. I can only imagine that only a minute amount of people making this actual claim...but perhaps a larger group of people are trying to say something else. What that might be, I am unsure because the claim seems to rest on this vague and limited wording.

&#x200B;

Claim 2: The climate changes, but isn't ""man-made"" or ""man-caused.""

&#x200B;

I am not sure how this can be asserted either since there are deleterious effects that can be directly connected to unnaturally occurring events that caused negative impacts on the planet (i.e. Deep Horizon oil spill or CFCs depleting the ozone layer)

&#x200B;

Of the people I've talked to that are skeptical about what science says about climate change, I haven't heard anything in detail that they refute or reject that is in detail...or that isn't one of the two above arguments.

&#x200B;

CC skeptics that I've talked with don't offer a clearly outlined or thought out claim that they believe that could be subject to examination and refutation. I am unsure if this is done deliberately so there position is unassailable or if it's because of an inability to articulate one's position.

&#x200B;

The end result either way is that you aren't able to disprove or refute their claim if there isn't a clear understanding of what they think climate change is and what they don't accept about it. So it's unproductive to discuss without them clarifying their stance.

&#x200B;

\- Growing Population, that lives longer. (People at elderly age have now seen our world population ***TRIPLE in their life times) and we're set for more.***

\- Populations across the world becoming more developed (Thus using tons more resources that they traditionally used in the past) **If you take energy use alone into account, we now use 5 TIMES the amount of energy than we did back in the 1950s) Coal/gas/oil use STILL rising fast.**

\- The actual impact of rising sea levels and loss of land due to this and urbanisation / soil erosion.

\- The declining availability of ground water in MANY regions across the world which those people totally depend on.

\- (Plus many other countless factors - changes or collapses of delicate ecosystems has knock on effects)

Seems to me it's all coming closer to one very extreme crisis, the balance that humanity has with it's sustainability on this planet is getting more and more unstable, and I believe ultimately the inaction of our elite/governments bring us evermore closer to tipping the scales.

I travel a lot, as does my boyfriend.  Between us we've been to some of Europe, some of Asia, and most of the Americas.  And while we've been traveling, there's been something that's been weighing heavily in my mind.

While the US is no Japan or Sweden when it comes to environmental cleanliness, we are leaps and bounds above countries like Thailand, with horrible rivers filled with trash and sewage, or China, where some parts of the atmosphere is so poluted and toxic there are days that people cannot safely walk around outside.

Heck, even Italy has a horrendous trash problem.  I saw it literally everywhere, shoved into nooks and cranies of crumbling walls, and even just plied up in some streets.  Their beaches are filled with sea glass.

So my question is, if the situation is as dire as we say it is, why are we not actively focusing on helping to build better systems in other countries?  I hear a lot about how the US is terrible with our climate problems, but as far as I see, we lie somewhere higher on the cleanliness scale than many other countries.

Wouldn't it make more sense to fix the much larger climate issues produced by other countries first?  It seems to me like the US gets a lot of flak for our climate policies, but i rarely hear anything about what other countries are activwly doing.  Or am I completely missing the point?",0.0,0.0,1.0

If things go the way we all hope they will in the future, the internal combustion will be obsolete, and gasoline production will be minimal.

[SERIOUS],"Not a skeptic or anything but I'm curious if there is consensus on how bad things could get in the future. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_impacts_of_climate_change suggests that the issue is still up for debate. 

I know that perhaps not everything can be captured under economic impact but I'm assuming a significant portion of both positive and negative effects are. For example if more people die of heatwaves or if we have mosquitoes spreading malaria in more northern latitudes, that's probably also bad from an economic point of view.

Is the correct way to explain climate change then the following
1) Humans are causing it and we can prove that
2) There will be significant changes that affect humans as a result
3) We have no idea if these changes could be good, neutral or bad but why take such a big gamble? ",0.0,0.179,0.821

Try to go there and provide links to the hard evidence supporting or refuting the claim. Real hard evidence is scattered and hidden all over the web, in obscure publications and repositories, and is not easy to find if you are not part of the climate science community. With help from the crowd here we, society at large, might get a little wiser.

You can also deliberate, and provide arguments and opinions through the consider.it UI on the claim page, but more importantly the claim needs to be supported or refuted by the hard evidence (data sets, simulations, experiments, analysis, methods used in the analysis, video, software, reproduction of results, etc. etc.).

I apologize for my english (not a native speaker) but I really need your help. My father (I'm his oldest daughter) is denying that the global warming is caused by humans and the CO2 we produce. His main argument is, that there is no connection between CO2 and temperature in sense of higher CO2 results in a higher temperature. I, in contrary, trust the majority of scientist, so I think, that we have to reduce our CO2 output. Both my father and me are electrical engineers, so we have a basic understanding of physics but not of climate science.

So here comes the videos he refers to (sorry, they are in german): 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F33gDVNuGJk
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsRCPT-_wdc

He thinks because those persons are professors (the first one is from the research field, the second one has a nobel price in physics but not in climate related things) they have to be right. My argument that there are so many professors telling excact the opposite thing doesn't count for some reason.


So here are the two charts he presented as evidence and my questions how to explain them:
1) http://www.biokurs.de/treibhaus/CO2-Dateien/paleo4.gif 
Shows no correlation between CO2 and temperature. Is the chart correct? Is it wrong? How can I explain this?
2) https://www.eike-klima-energie.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Abbildung_6-25.jpg Shows that the temperature rises first and then the CO2 concentration (in the video it says because the oceans are emitting CO2 if it is warm). Is this chart right? How to explain it?
3) He criticizes that there are only 8 measurement stations to measure the temperature on the Antarctic. And he thinks, that someone is not able to measure an global average temperature. So how to do it?

Here's the trend line of Arctic Sea Ice Volume over the last 40 years. We are clearly in a phase of steady decline with year to year variability due to weather. Sea ice minimum has steadily declined from 17M km3 to 5M km3 during that interval.

[http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice\_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png](http://psc.apl.uw.edu/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/schweiger/ice_volume/BPIOMASIceVolumeAprSepCurrent.png)

&#x200B;

A Blue Ocean event is more than just symbolic. A lot of energy is necessary to convert ice from solid to liquid state. When the ice is gone, all of that energy will be used to heat the ocean. In addition, the lost albedo (we've already lost a lot) will alsomean greater heat absorption. This represents a significant phase change in the earth's climate system.

&#x200B;

If you examine the trend line in the graph, the case for a Blue Ocean event in the suggested time line is pretty evident. Deniers will point to extremists like MacPherson making past predictions of accelerated demise of Arctic ice as a means of detracting from mainstream science projections. They're making a spurious argument.

It will get rid of us sooner than you think,"I was reading this Scientific American article and it reminded me on how we humans think we are intelligent when we are actually underestimating the greater universe, nature and all the things surrounding us. Nature is much more intelligent than what we hallucinate here.

As the [article](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/hot-planet/climate-change-were-not-literally-doomed-but/) says, humans are crap on predicting the future. 

*Humans are terrible at thinking about probabilities, as every weather forecaster on the receiving end of abuse for being “wrong” well knows.*

That is because we are programmed by society to think linearly. But the universe works exponentially. What I mean is, we are probably going to experience extreme disaster much much earlier than we thought we would. I feel as if humans are predicting a dire situation for the next generation (like in this article), it will actually happen in the next few years. Maybe in the next decade, who knows?  Humans know shit about the future. When things like this happen, they accelerate exponentially and most humans fail miserably on seeing that coming. I'm not talking about human extinction but huge paradigm shift events like massive bushfires, colossal sequential hurricanes, massive draughts... you name it. Events that are enough to change humanity forever. Stuff like what WW2 was for mankind. That could be even related to how climate change will affect food supply, just like the a [famine and the volcanic eruption that changed mankind forever.](https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/a-volcanic-eruption-with-global-repercussions-an-irishman-s-diary-on-1816-the-year-without-a-summer-1.2760797)

To me, nature has given a lot of warnings on what's going on, it is like the planet is having a fever because it's trying to fight us like antibodies fighting viruses in our own bodies. 

No I'm not pessimistic, I think this will end up being a good thing. Why? Because the faster we get violently slapped in the face by nature, the better. We are not quite there yet. But once we are humbled back to our primitive, maybe we will be able to think like the nature wants us to think again, and react exponentially. And therefore, save the planet because there will be no deniers left when **REAL** disaster hits.

I will probably get downvoted to hell with this, but this is something that has bugged me for a while now and I do hope/believe that this is a place we can have some healthy discussion about this.  

**For some reason I feel the need to clarify that I do believe in climate change and support all actions towards trying to fix it. I have stopped eating red meat and reduced my car usage a lot.**

In a nutshell, I am worried that climate change is being used as a political tool to convoke fear to the people of my generation (I'm in mid 20's). To some of you, this may seem very obvious, but it feels like whole Reddit is moving towards this sort of fanatic anti-discussion board that reminds me of 2016 US election.

For example: 

https://www.commondreams.org/news/2018/10/20/teen-climate-activist-crowd-thousands-we-cant-save-world-playing-rules-because-rules

This is an article I just saw on top of r/all. It seemed like a lot of people agreed with the article and with the kid. **Nothing wrong with that.**

But,

What bothers me is that anybody that even questions anything about the article (for example what does she mean with ""Rules have to change?"") is downvoted to oblivion. There is no room for discussion, you either support her 100% or you are a ""bot"".

Like I said, this really reminds me of US Presidental elections in 2016. If you even hinted that you could maybe agree with Trump on something, you were labeled as a bot/racist/facist and downvoted to hell. I'm from EU and I don't support Trump at all, but in my opinion that's really unhealthy discussion. It also divides people even more.

From the top of my head, here are some things that will get you downvoted if you don't agree with them.

* We need to take drastic action now, even though we don't have a clear plan for it.
* We need to ""change the system"", even though nobody knows how and to what.
* We are screwed and nobody is doing anything.

Sorry, I'm just tired of seeing this same thing happen to every IMPORTANT topic that **should absolutely be discussed about**. It happened with Immigration Crisis in EU, it happened with 2016 US elections and will happen to climate change eventually.

>Source: [http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15\_spm\_final.pdf](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_spm_final.pdf)

 

There are multiple CDR methods [considered](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_chapter3.pdf) , the IPCC report further states:  

>C3.1. Existing and potential CDR measures include afforestation and reforestation, land restoration and soil carbon sequestration, BECCS, direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS), enhanced weathering and ocean alkalinization. **These differ widely in terms of maturity, potentials, costs, risks, co-benefits and trade-offs.**

&#x200B;

With DACCS being the only one that [doesn't have a large impact on land use](http://report.ipcc.ch/sr15/pdf/sr15_chapter4.pdf) (IPCC Chapter four;  Section 4.3.7.5 ).

&#x200B;

And according to Quartz ([qz.com](https://qz.com)) only three startups have so far developed technology to do direct air carbon capture and storage (DACCS). 

>Climeworks, a Swiss company, is one among three startups in the world  working on direct air capture. In October 2017, it launched a demonstration project at a geothermal power plant in Iceland.

&#x200B;

So, it looks like there's a lot of innovation to be done in the area of Carbon Dioxide Removal - to improve general understanding of the different methods, to optimize their efficiency, and to bring down their respective costs.

As such this seems to me to be akin to a renewable cycle. As such I have an issue to see how agriculture contributes to climate change, because it doesn't add any new Carbon to the Carbon Cycle, it's just part of the normal Carbon Cycle.

the effects of N and P in runoff from agricultural regions. Increased 
Si:N and/or Si:P ratios in runoff reaching coastal waters from soils 
amended with silicates might favour the growth of diatoms over prob
lematic non-siliceous algae that produce toxins, red tides (dinoflagellate blooms), foam (Phaeocystis blooms) and scum (cyanobacterial blooms). Such a changed nutrient balance could also beneficially preserve or increase downstream food web and fisheries production because diatoms are the preferred diet of pelagic and benthic grazers, mostly copepods and bivalves, and increase marine biological CO2 drawdown and storage with economic benefits in particular regions. For example, the Great Barrier Reef is adjacent to the main sugarcane growing regions in Australia, where adding crushed basalt to soils may not only enhance sugarcane production, but also improve runoff and ground water chemistry while countering ocean acidity via the addition of alkaline leachate..

Does it garner any respect?

982,ChineseZeroToHero,8,0.79,Is deforestation more urgent than global warming?,"**This is a question on the IELTS test**

While some people consider global warming to be the most pressing environmental problem which we have at the moment, others believe that deforestation has a more devastating impact on our world. Discuss both sides and give your opinion.  


**This is my response**

Some people think that climate change should be addressed first, whereas others propose that deforestation takes on greater urgency. Although each side makes a valid point, I would argue that both are important issues that must be addressed in our generation.

Those who favor climate change may argue that rising temperature will make our planet uninhabitable. The emission of CO2-gases trap heat from the sun, creating the well-known ""green-house effect."" If such changes are unchecked, the ramifications can be enormous. Rising tides will reshape our coastlines. Large areas near the ocean will be rendered uninhabitable. Were this to happen, coastal cities must redefine their coastlines and create infrastructure that controls flooding. Global warming also creates unpredictable weather patterns. Large-scale hurricanes and typhoons will continue to scourge us and our children if temperatures continue to rise. The heat itself can also threaten our health, as the 2003 heatwave in Europe has clearly demonstrated. The effect of global warming cannot be overlooked.

On the other hand, those who favor deforestation also have a point to make. They argue that diminishing forest area will mean the extinction of species, many of which are yet to be discovered. These uncatalogued species can potentially hold the key to treating certain diseases.  It is anyone's guess how many ""penicillins"" are yet to be found among them. If these habitats are lost, there will never be another chance to make these discoveries. Deforestation can also adversely affect our climate. Because plants use photosynthesis to convert CO2 to O2, large-scale destruction of forests can throw our fragile system out of balance. With increased CO2 level, this can in turn cause global warming and create a vicious cycle.

With these arguments considered, it is evident that both issues must be seriously looked at. The problems they create and counter-measures we can take are not independent, but inter-related. Therefore, instead of concentrating all our energy to alleviate global warming before deforestation, both should be tackled at the same time. When we create economic incentives to curb clear-cutting, for example, we are not just saving trees, but we are also saving clean air and CO2 absorbers. When we create policies to discourage CO2 emission, we are not just lowering atmospheric temperature, we are creating conditions for forests to thrive, especially those found at warmer and coastal regions.

Having considered the above, I would argue that actions should be taken to address both deforestation and global warming in parallel.",0.425,0.0,0.575
